## EMAIL 1: CORY DOCTOROW (Priority #1)

**To:** doctorow@craphound.com
**Subject:** Evidence backing your "enshittification" thesis

**Body:**
```
Hi Cory,

I documented your "enshittification" thesis with comprehensive evidence.

Key findings on Big Tech monopoly sabotage:
• Microsoft removed 12 features in 2024 (WordPad, Android apps, recovery tools)
• AI creates "learned helplessness" - 20% skill decline in 3 months (physicians)
• Developers 19% SLOWER with AI tools, not faster (2025 study)
• 67% cloud infrastructure controlled by 3 companies

I've compiled 530 lines of research with 18 sources (Wharton, Oxford, HBR,
Brookings) connecting the pattern across Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple.

Called it the "Corporate Delivery Mask" - solutions that appear to help
but actually degrade capability while creating dependency.

Full brief available if useful for your work. Happy to share.

Best,
Šabad

**How to send:**
1. Open Gmail or your email
2. Copy everything between the ``` marks
3. Paste into email
4. Send

## EMAIL 2: 404 MEDIA (Priority #2)

**To:** jason@404media.co
**CC:** joseph@404media.co
**Subject:** Research brief: Big Tech productivity sabotage

**Body:**
```
Hi Jason & Joseph,

I've compiled evidence that Big Tech is deliberately sabotaging
productivity tools to force AI dependency and subscription lock-in.

Documented pattern:
• Feature removal: Microsoft killed 12 features in 2024 (WordPad, recovery
  tools, Android app support) to force paid upgrades
• Broken updates: August 2025 security patch broke Windows recovery tools
• AI dependency trap: Creates "learned helplessness" with measurable skill
  degradation (20% decline in 3 months)
• Monopoly maintenance: 67% cloud market controlled by 3 companies

Full research brief (530 lines, 18 cited sources) connects this to
ongoing antitrust cases and shows it's coordinated strategy, not bugs.

Fits your coverage of surveillance tech and Big Tech control mechanisms.

Brief available if you're interested in the story.

Best,
Šabad
```

## EMAIL 3: THE INTERCEPT

**To:** submissions@theintercept.com
**Subject:** Story pitch: Big Tech monopoly sabotage documentation

**Body:**
```
Subject: Big Tech Monopoly Sabotage - Comprehensive Evidence

I've documented how Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple are deliberately:

1. Sabotaging productivity tools (12 features removed in 2024)
2. Creating AI dependency that degrades human skills (20% decline in 3 months)
3. Breaking their own software to force upgrades (security patches broke recovery tools)
4. Maintaining infrastructure monopoly (67% cloud market share)

This connects to ongoing antitrust enforcement and shows systematic
strategy across all major tech companies.

Research brief includes:
• 18 academic & journalistic sources
• Antitrust case evidence
• Measured skill degradation data
• Timeline of deliberate sabotage

Happy to provide full brief and discuss story angles.

Contact: [your email]

Best,
Šabad

## EMAIL 4: ARS TECHNICA

**To:** tips@arstechnica.com
**Subject:** Research: AI tools make developers 19% slower (not faster)

**Body:**
```
Hi Ars team,

You might be interested in this: AI coding tools make developers 19%
SLOWER, not faster, according to 2025 METR study.

I've compiled evidence showing this is part of larger pattern:

• AI creates "learned helplessness" - skills degrade without awareness
• Physicians: 20% diagnostic decline after 3 months AI use
• Developers: 19% longer task completion with AI tools
• 41% of workers encounter "workslop" requiring 2 hours rework

This connects to Big Tech's deliberate strategy:
- Strip features from local tools (Microsoft killed 12 in 2024)
- Force cloud/AI dependency
- Create subscription lock-in
- Degrade user capability while appearing to help

Full research brief (18 sources, 530 lines) available.

Could be interesting for your AI/developer audience.

Best,
Šabad

## EMAIL 5: GIZMODO

**To:** tips@gizmodo.com
**Subject:** Microsoft's 2024 sabotage: 12 features killed, recovery tools broken

**Body:**
```
Hi Gizmodo,

Microsoft removed 12 Windows features in 2024 alone:
- WordPad (forcing paid Office)
- Android app support (headline Win11 feature)
- Windows Mixed Reality (rendering VR headsets useless)
- Recovery tools (broken by security update)

This isn't incompetence - it's strategy. I've documented the pattern:

1. Strip free features → force paid upgrades
2. Break recovery tools → force support subscriptions
3. Deploy AI tools → create dependency + skill atrophy
4. Cloud lock-in → can't work without subscription

Full research brief shows this across Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple
with academic sources (Wharton, Oxford, HBR).

Story angle: "Corporate Delivery Mask" - tools that appear helpful but
actually degrade capability.

Brief available if interested.

Best,
Šabad
