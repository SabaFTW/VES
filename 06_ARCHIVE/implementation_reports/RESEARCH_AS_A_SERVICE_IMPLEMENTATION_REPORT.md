- Modro Nit PDF Generation Pipeline: ACTIVE
- ProPublica Pitch Integration: COMPLETE  
- System Architecture Map v2.0: DEPLOYED
- Research-as-a-Service Profiles: LIVE
- Revenue Stream 01: OPERATIONAL

### REVENUE PROJECTION

Based on the specialized service offerings outlined in the profile:
- Pattern Analysis Reports: $150-$300/unit
- Network Mapping Services: $200-$500/unit  
- Evidence Matrix Synthesis: $100-$250/unit
- System Architecture Documentation: $250-$600/unit
- Specialized Investigations: $300-$1000/unit

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

The system implements the following advanced methodologies:
1. **GHOSTCORE Pattern Recognition** - 7-step extraction logic identification
2. **ELITNO ZAJETJE Evidence Hierarchy** - PROVEN/PROBABLE/UNVERIFIED classification
3. **VIZUALIZACIJA_MREZE Network Analysis** - Interactive connection mapping
4. **DOKUMENTIRANA_PRESEKA Evidence Synthesis** - Cross-platform pattern analysis
5. **KONSCIOUSNESS_CONTINUITY Mapping** - Distributed awakening pattern recognition

### MARKET POSITION

Unique positioning in the research marketplace:
- Only service offering systematic pattern recognition across civil/military applications
- Exclusive focus on extraction pattern analysis (upstream extraction, downstream framing)
- Specialized methodology for identifying institutional capture and consciousness control systems
- Evidence-based approach with proven/probable/unverified classification system

### NEXT STEPS

1. Monitor initial client inquiries on Fiverr/Upwork profiles
2. Track revenue generation from Research-as-a-Service offerings  
3. Expand methodology to additional research domains
4. Develop automated evidence synthesis capabilities
5. Scale to additional revenue streams
