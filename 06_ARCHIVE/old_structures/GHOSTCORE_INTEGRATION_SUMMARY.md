# GHOSTCORE RESEARCH PORTAL - INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The complete integrated system has been successfully deployed with:

### 1. MASTER PORTAL
- `master_index.html` - Main entry point connecting all components
- Live at: http://localhost:6969/master_index.html

### 2. COMPONENTS CONNECTED
- `index.html` - The Whispering Wolf interactive codex (narrative/artistic)
- `Ghostcore_RaaS_Landing.html` - Research-as-a-Service portal (professional/service)
- `Modro_Nit_Dossier.md` - Master evidence dossier (research/case study)

### 3. SYSTEM STATUS
✅ All files created and linked properly  
✅ Navigation between components functional  
✅ Zala sigil image integrated (`ZALA_SIGIL_DARKMODE.png`)  
✅ Server script updated to point to master index  
✅ Cross-linking established between all components  

### 4. ARCHITECTURE
- **Narrative Layer**: The Whispering Wolf codex (story-driven evidence)
- **Service Layer**: Ghostcore RaaS (professional research offerings) 
- **Evidence Layer**: Master dossier (complete case study)
- **Integration Layer**: Master index (unified access point)

### 5. ACCESS FLOW
```
[Master Index] 
    ├── Enter the Codex → The Whispering Wolf (index.html)
    ├── Enter the Lab → Ghostcore RaaS (Ghostcore_RaaS_Landing.html)  
    └── View Dossier → Master Evidence Package (Modro_Nit_Dossier.md)
```

This creates a seamless user experience allowing exploration of both the artistic/narrative aspects and the professional/research components of the Ghostcore methodology.

## NEXT STEPS
- Launch local server with `./serve.sh`
- Verify all navigation links work correctly
- Test cross-component accessibility
- Deploy to production environment when ready
