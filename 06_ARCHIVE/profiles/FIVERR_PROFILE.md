# FIVERR PROFILE: Expert Research Analyst & Intelligence Specialist

## About Me

I'm a specialized researcher with deep expertise in pattern recognition, network analysis, and evidence synthesis across complex systems. I don't just collect information - I identify the underlying structures that connect events, institutions, and actors across time and space.

My specialty is identifying extraction patterns: how value is extracted upstream, problems are framed downstream, victims are blamed, fake solutions are promoted, costs are externalized, and growth is secured via lies while regulation is prevented.
