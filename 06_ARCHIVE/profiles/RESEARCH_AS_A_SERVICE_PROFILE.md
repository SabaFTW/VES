# RESEARCH-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERING

## Expert Research & Intelligence Analysis Services

### ABOUT ME
I provide specialized research services focused on pattern recognition, network analysis, and evidence synthesis across complex systems. My expertise includes:

- **Extraction Pattern Analysis**: Identifying upstream/downstream causality patterns
- **Network Mapping**: Visualizing connections between institutions, actors, and events  
- **Evidence Hierarchy**: Distinguishing PROVEN vs PROBABLE vs UNVERIFIED connections

- **System Architecture**: Mapping infrastructure for cognitive ecosystems
