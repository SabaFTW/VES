## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research brief provides comprehensive evidence that Big Tech companies
deliberately sabotage productivity tools, create AI dependency, and maintain
monopoly control through coordinated strategy.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Monopoly Infrastructure Control**
   67% of cloud computing controlled by 3 companies (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

2. **Systematic Feature Removal**
   Microsoft removed 12 features in 2024 alone to force paid upgrades

3. **AI Dependency Trap**
   AI tools create measurable skill degradation (20% decline in 3 months)

4. **Deliberate Sabotage**
   Security updates broke recovery tools; interfaces deliberately degraded

5. **Coordinated Strategy**
   Pattern repeats across Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple - not isolated incidents

**Evidence Included:**
- Antitrust case documentation (Google Search, Microsoft Teams, Apple App Store)
- Academic research on AI skill atrophy (Wharton, Oxford, PMC)
- Technical documentation of feature removal and broken updates
- Measured productivity impact (developers 19% SLOWER with AI tools)

**Use Cases:**
- Investigative journalism
- Antitrust legal cases
- Policy research
- Academic citations
- Public awareness campaigns
