## PITCH TEMPLATE (Copy-paste ready)

### For Direct Sales:

```
Subject: Research Brief: Big Tech Monopoly Sabotage Evidence

I've compiled comprehensive evidence that Microsoft, Google, Amazon,
Apple, and Meta are deliberately:

• Sabotaging productivity tools to create dependency
• Deploying AI that causes skill atrophy
• Stripping features to force cloud migration
• Maintaining monopoly control through "technofeudalism"

This 530-line research brief includes:
✓ 18 cited sources (Wharton, Oxford, HBR, Brookings)
✓ Antitrust case evidence (Google, Apple, Microsoft)
✓ Measured skill degradation data (20% decline in 3 months)
✓ "AI Efficiency Trap" documentation
✓ Microsoft's 12 removed features (2024)

Ready for immediate use in reporting, legal cases, or policy work.

Price: $75 (individual) / $100 (organization)

### For Media Outlets:

```
Subject: Pitch: Big Tech Monopoly Sabotage Investigation

Hi [Editor Name],

I've compiled evidence that Big Tech companies are deliberately
degrading productivity tools while creating AI dependency.

Key findings:
• Microsoft removed 12 features in 2024, forcing paid upgrades
• AI tools cause 20% skill decline in 3 months (physicians study)
• Developers are 19% SLOWER with AI tools (not faster)
• 67% of cloud infrastructure controlled by 3 companies

I've documented the pattern across Microsoft, Google, Amazon,
and Apple with 18 academic/journalistic sources.

This connects to ongoing antitrust cases and provides evidence
of systematic strategy vs. isolated incidents.

Full brief available. Happy to discuss angles for [Outlet Name].

Best,
Šabad
