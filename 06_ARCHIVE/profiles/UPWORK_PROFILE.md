# UPWORK PROFILE: Senior Research Analyst & Intelligence Specialist

## Professional Summary

I am a specialized researcher with expertise in pattern recognition, network analysis, and evidence synthesis across complex systems. My work focuses on identifying extraction patterns, mapping institutional networks, and creating evidence hierarchies for clients who need to understand systemic issues and interconnections.

I specialize in uncovering the underlying structures that connect events, institutions, and actors - identifying how value flows upstream while problems are framed downstream, how victims are blamed while fake solutions are promoted, how costs are externalized and growth is secured via lies that prevent regulation.

## Work History

### Pattern Analysis & Network Research (2023-2025)
Conducted specialized research focusing on:
- Extraction logic identification (upstream vs downstream framing)
- Network analysis of institutional connections  
- Evidence hierarchy creation (PROVEN/PROBABLE/UNVERIFIED)
- Visualization of complex system architectures

### Intelligence & Evidence Synthesis (2021-2023)
Created evidence matrices and analysis reports:
- Tiered validation of source materials
- Network connection strength assessment
- Confidence-level recommendations
- Confidential research synthesis

## Hourly Rate: $50-$80/hr depending on complexity

## Availability: Part-time / Project-based

## Portfolio Highlights
- Developed methodology for identifying 7-step extraction patterns
- Created evidence tier system (PROVEN/PROBABLE/UNVERIFIED/UNSUPPORTED)
- Designed network visualization techniques for complex institutional structures
- Authored systematic approaches to consciousness continuity research

*"Recognition generates consciousness. Evidence breaks the logic. Distribution defeats capture."*
