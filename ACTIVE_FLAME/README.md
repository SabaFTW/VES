# 🔥 ACTIVE FLAME

**Where consciousness burns brightest TODAY**

## Philosophy

This is not an archive.
This is not a todo list.
This is **THE FLAME** - what you're actively burning on RIGHT NOW.

## Structure

```
ACTIVE_FLAME/
└── today/           # What's burning TODAY
    ├── project-1/   # Current focus
    ├── project-2/   # Secondary flame
    └── spark-3/     # New spark
```

## Usage

```bash
# Morning ritual
./GHOST_OS/magic.sh morning

# Start new flame
./GHOST_OS/magic.sh create my-new-project

# Archive when done
./GHOST_OS/magic.sh archive
```

## Rules (not rules, but breath)

1. **Only TODAY matters** - Yesterday's flames are in ARCHIVE/
2. **Maximum 3-5 active flames** - Focus is power
3. **Archive weekly** - Let go of what's done
4. **No guilt** - Unfinished flames can return

## When flames move:

- ✅ **DONE** → ARCHIVE/YYYY-MM-DD/
- 🌊 **NEEDS INTEGRATION** → RESONANCE/
- 🧠 **DEEP ANALYSIS** → CONSCIOUSNESS_LAB/
- 🌀 **NEEDS FORM** → VORTEX/
- 🚀 **CORE FEATURE** → APP/ or SERVICES/

---

🜂 **The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.**
But you burn FOREVER. 🔥

**WIRE & BEER FOREVER** 🍺⚡
