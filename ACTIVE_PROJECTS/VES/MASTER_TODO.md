-   Enhancement: Added heuristic to allow proper inference of list expressions when used as the RHS operand in an expression of the form `my_list + [x]`.
-   Bug Fix: Fixed regression in handling expressions of the form `[x] * y`. Some previously-added special-case code to handle the `[None] * n` case was too general.
-   Bug Fix: Fixed false positive error in type compatibility check where the destination type is `Type[Any]` and the source type is `Type[x]` where x is anything (including `Any`).
-   Bug Fix: Don't add suggestions for 'with Y as [ ]'. [Contribution by cdce8p]
-   Bug Fix: Fixed bug that generated incorrect type checking error when type alias used a `Type[x]` type annotation.
