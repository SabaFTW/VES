# 0. PROLOGUE

## Purpose
A clear forensic map of the structures shaping human focus, power, information, and consciousness.

## Why the Iceberg Method
Because truth appears in layers:
- visible surface (plastic)
- structural systems (corruption)
- deep architecture (DARPA)
- hidden incentives (extraction)
- forbidden ties (Epstein)
- final layer (consciousness + AI)

## What This Document Is
Evidence-backed, source-driven, pattern-mapped descent.

## Reading Rules
- No fear-based interpretation.
- No ideology.
- No tribalism.
- Only evidence → connection → conclusion.
