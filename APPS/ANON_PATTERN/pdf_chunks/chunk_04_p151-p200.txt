funded a political network aligned with these beliefs:

**“The Education of a Libertarian” (2009, Cato Unbound)**: Thiel’s clearest statement of
political philosophy:

> “I must confess that over the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of
how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, **I no longer believe that freedom and
democracy are compatible.**”

On women’s suffrage and welfare:

> “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise
to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered
the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.”

On escaping democracy:

> “In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms…
We are in a deadly race between politics and technology.”

**“The Straussian Moment” (2007)**: Post-9/11 manifesto arguing liberal democracy is
“decadent and exhausted,” drawing on Leo Strauss’s philosophy of “noble lies”
(elite-maintained myths to control society). Advocates for strong executive power and
surveillance state.

**“The Diversity Myth” (1995)**: Co-authored with David O. Sacks, attacking multiculturalism
and diversity initiatives at Stanford. Contains controversial passage on “multicultural rape
charge may indicate nothing more than a belated regret” (Thiel later apologized for being
“insensitive”).

### Curtis Yarvin Connection: DOCUMENTED IDEOLOGICAL ALLIANCE

**Evidence Quality: ★★★★ (Financial Records, Leaked Communications)**

Curtis Yarvin (pen name Mencius Moldbug) is a neoreactionary blogger who advocates for:

- Replacing democracy with CEO-monarch governance
- Race-based hierarchy with “biological roots of intelligence”
- Endorsement of slavery as “natural human relationship”
- Praised by white nationalists; spoke at neo-Nazi platforms

**Thiel’s Financial Support**: Founders Fund invested in Yarvin’s startup Tlon/Urbit (2013);
Thiel gave $100,000 to Tlon co-founder (2011); **Thiel remained Yarvin investor after
TechCrunch outed him** as neoreactionary figure.

**Direct Collaboration Evidence**: BuzzFeed obtained 2016 leaked emails where Yarvin told
Milo Yiannopoulos:

- “I’ve been **coaching Thiel**”
- “I watched the election at his house”
- “He’s **fully enlightened**, just plays it very carefully”

=== Page 152 ===
When journalist confronted Thiel about Yarvin connection in 2014, Thiel responded: “I found
that vaguely flattering. It was the full-on conspiracy theory”—**denied nothing**.

**Ideological Convergence**: Both reject democracy-freedom compatibility; both advocate
CEO-monarch governance; both influenced by Leo Strauss, Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt.
Max Chafkin’s 2021 biography describes Yarvin as “house political philosopher” of Thiel’s
network.

### Political Funding: DOCUMENTED ($50+ MILLION)

**Evidence Quality: ★★★★★ (FEC Records via OpenSecrets)**

**2022 Election Cycle: $35+ million** (Among top 10 largest individual donors)

- **J.D. Vance (Ohio Senate)**: $15 million to Protect Ohio Values PAC
- **Blake Masters (Arizona Senate)**: $20 million to Saving Arizona PAC
- Total: 16 federal races funded

**J.D. Vance Relationship**: Now U.S. Vice President; Thiel’s most successful political
investment:

- First meeting: 2011 after Thiel spoke at Yale Law School
- Employment: Partner at Thiel’s Mithril Capital (2016-2017)
- Venture backing: Thiel backed Vance’s Narya Capital fund (2019)
- Political launch: $15 million to Senate super PAC (2022)
- Trump introduction: Thiel brought Vance to Mar-a-Lago (2021) to reconcile with Trump
- Ideological alignment: Vance cites Curtis Yarvin as friend/mentor, uses Yarvin’s “RAGE”
(Retire All Government Employees) rhetoric

**Blake Masters**: Former COO of Thiel Capital, President of Thiel Foundation; co-author of
“Zero to One” with Thiel; echoes Yarvin’s anti-democracy rhetoric; $20 million from Thiel
(lost 2022 Arizona Senate race).

**2016 Election**: $2+ million including critical $1.25 million to Trump campaign after
Access Hollywood tape; member of Trump transition team executive committee; speaker at
Republican National Convention.

**Other Major Funding**:

- **2012**: $3.9 million to Ron Paul presidential campaign
- **2012**: $1 million to Club for Growth (became largest contributor)
- Ted Cruz, Meg Whitman, multiple Senate candidates

### Rockbridge Network: DARK MONEY INFRASTRUCTURE

**Evidence Quality: ★★★★ (Investigative Journalism)**

Conservative coalition co-founded by J.D. Vance and Chris Buskirk (2019) with Thiel as
major donor/backer:

=== Page 153 ===
- Planned $30 million spending on conservative media, litigation, policy advocacy, voter
registration (2022 cycle)
- International network with Asian branches
- Other major donors: Rebekah Mercer, Winklevoss twins
- Exclusive membership: $100,000-$1 million annual commitments
- Multiple Mar-a-Lago gatherings with Trump appearances

**Per Aspera Policy**: Dark money nonprofit that funneled $200,000+ to J.D. Vance’s super
PAC.

### Steve Bannon Connection: DOCUMENTED CONTACT

**Evidence Quality: ★★★ (Emails, Schedule Records)**

**Cambridge Analytica**: CNN obtained 2014 emails showing Palantir employee Alfredas
Chmieliauskas contacted Cambridge Analytica about data collaboration. Palantir claimed
employee acted without authorization.

**Epstein Triangle**: House Oversight documents show Bannon scheduled for February 16,
2019 breakfast with Epstein— another node in the network.

**Ideological Overlap**: Bannon described as “fan of Dark Enlightenment,” read Yarvin and
Nick Land. No evidence of ongoing close Thiel-Bannon relationship.

## IV. Network Synthesis: Patterns of Elite Capture

### The Interconnected System

This forensic analysis reveals a multi-layered network operating through legal mechanisms:

**Financial Layer**:

- Epstein invested $40 million in Thiel’s Valar Ventures (2015-2016)
- Deutsche Bank enabled Epstein’s financial operations despite criminal history (2013-2018)
- $350+ million in regulatory penalties failed to produce criminal charges
- Investment now worth $170 million, benefiting Epstein estate and Thiel’s fund

**Technological Layer**:

- Palantir provides surveillance infrastructure to ICE, military, intelligence agencies
- $10+ billion in government contracts enable mass data collection
- Technology used in family separation, predictive policing, mass surveillance
- No democratic oversight or transparency; proprietary systems resist accountability

**Ideological Layer**:

- Thiel explicitly rejects democracy-freedom compatibility
- Funds Curtis Yarvin (anti-democratic neoreactionary philosopher)
- $50+ million to reshape Republican Party toward authoritarianism
- Protégé J.D. Vance now Vice President

=== Page 154 ===
**Institutional Layer**:

- Deutsche Bank prioritized profit over compliance (5-year Epstein relationship)
- Regulatory enforcement produced fines but no criminal prosecution
- Congressional investigations blocked by Treasury Department
- Non-disparagement agreements silence employees; stock holdings create compliance

### Evidence Quality Assessment by Connection Type

**DOCUMENTED/PROVEN (★★★★★)**:

- Thiel-Epstein: $40M Valar investment, multiple meetings 2014-2017
- Deutsche Bank-Epstein: 5-year relationship, $350M penalties, regulatory findings
- Palantir government contracts: $10B+ documented in USAspending.gov
- Thiel political funding: $50M+ in FEC records
- Thiel anti-democratic writings: Published in Cato Unbound, own essays
- Curtis Yarvin financial backing: Founders Fund investment records
- J.D. Vance funding: $15M documented, now Vice President

**PROBABLE (★★★★)**:

- Thiel-Yarvin ideological collaboration: Leaked emails, financial ties, ideological alignment
- Founders Fund Carbyne investment influenced by Epstein pitch: Timeline suggests
connection
- Palantir enabling human rights abuses: Internal documents, investigative journalism
- Elite network coordination: Meeting schedules, shared associates

**SPECULATIVE (★★)**:

- Thiel knowledge of Epstein’s crimes: No evidence beyond public information
- Full extent of surveillance capabilities: Much remains classified
- Future political ambitions: Subject of analysis but undocumented
- Degree of Vance policy independence from Thiel influence

**UNSUBSTANTIATED (★)**:

- Thiel direct Nazi ideology: No evidence; family history not evidence of personal beliefs
- Criminal conspiracy theories: Lacking documentation
- Thiel-Deutsche Bank strategic partnership: Only minimal transactional connections found

## V. Institutional Corruption Mechanisms

### How Legal Frameworks Enable Elite Networks

**Regulatory Capture**: Deutsche Bank paid $350+ million in penalties but no executives
faced criminal charges. NYDFS found bank “may have enabled” continued crimes, yet
enforcement was limited to fines. This creates cost-of-doing-business calculation where
profit outweighs compliance.

**Government Contracting Opacity**: Palantir’s $10+ billion in contracts operate with minimal
transparency. Proprietary technology resists oversight; national security classifications

=== Page 155 ===
prevent scrutiny; revolving door between company and government (Stephen Miller holds
$100K+ Palantir stock while shaping ICE policy).

**Political Spending as Speech**: Citizens United enables $50+ million in Thiel political
spending to reshape governance. Rockbridge Network operates as dark money;
non-disclosure agreements prevent transparency. Result: billionaire with anti-democratic
beliefs positions protégé as Vice President.

**Venture Capital as Power**: $40 million Epstein investment in Valar Ventures created
financial entanglement with no public disclosure requirement. VC fund structure “locks up”
money, preventing estate distribution to victims while Thiel’s fund benefits from investment
appreciation.

**Non-Disparagement Regime**: Palantir employees bound by NDAs and stock holdings
worth billions. May 2025 letter from 13 former employees was rare act of courage against
systematic silencing. Corporate structure prevents whistleblowing and accountability.

### Gaps in Public Evidence

**Limited by Classification**: Full extent of Palantir’s intelligence community work remains
classified. CIA relationship described as “recalcitrant” in 2015 video but current status
unknown.

**Treasury Department Obstruction**: Senator Wyden’s investigation into Epstein financial
network blocked when Trump Treasury Secretary revoked FinCEN access (2025). Over $4
billion in wire transfers involving Epstein (2003-2019) flagged but inaccessible.

**Private Communications**: Thiel-Yarvin coordination extent unknown beyond leaked 2016
emails. Full scope of “coaching” and “fully enlightened” status undocumented.

**Deutsche Bank Internal Records**: 2017 NYPD attempt to cancel Palantir contract failed
when “Palantir refused to provide data in standardized format”—suggesting proprietary
lock-in prevents institutional exit.

**Offshore Structures**: Epstein’s accounts used British Virgin Islands entities; full beneficial
ownership unclear in Deutsche Bank records.

## VI. Academic Context: Elite Capture Theory

This network exemplifies what scholars term “elite capture”—when institutions designed to
serve public interest are redirected to serve elite private interests:

**Financial Institutions**: Deutsche Bank’s compliance failures represent regulatory capture
where profit motive overrides gatekeeping function against financial crime. $4+ billion in
compliance remediation suggests systemic rot beyond single client relationship.

**Surveillance State**: Palantir represents privatization of intelligence capabilities, creating
dependency relationship where government cannot easily switch providers (NYPD
experience). Technology outpaces democratic oversight; proprietary systems resist
accountability.

=== Page 156 ===
**Democratic Institutions**: Thiel’s $50+ million political spending, combined with explicit
anti-democratic ideology, represents what political scientists call “plutocratic
capture”—wealthy individuals reshaping governance to align with personal philosophy rather
than democratic will.

**Ideological Networks**: Curtis Yarvin’s “fully enlightened” characterization of Thiel,
combined with financial backing and political coordination, exemplifies creation of parallel
intellectual infrastructure that legitimizes authoritarian governance among elite networks.

**Network Effects**: Epstein, Deutsche Bank, Thiel, Bannon, and Trump world represent
overlapping nodes in elite network where:

- Financial institutions enable operations despite criminal history
- Technology provides surveillance infrastructure
- Ideology justifies authoritarian governance
- Political spending translates wealth into institutional power
- Legal mechanisms prevent accountability

## Conclusion: Documented patterns of institutional corruption

This forensic analysis documents a multi-layered network operating through legal
mechanisms rather than criminal conspiracy. The most significant findings:

**Financial Nexus**: Jeffrey Epstein’s $40 million investment in Thiel’s Valar Ventures (now
$170 million) represents the largest documented financial connection between Epstein and
major tech figures. Deutsche Bank enabled this network by maintaining Epstein’s
relationship for five years despite documented knowledge of his crimes, processing
suspicious transactions that regulators found “may have enabled” continued criminal activity.

**Surveillance Infrastructure**: Palantir’s $10+ billion in government contracts provide
technological backbone for mass deportations, predictive policing, and intelligence
surveillance with minimal democratic oversight. Internal documents and employee testimony
confirm technology was used in family separation, workplace raids, and racially biased
targeting.

**Ideological Capture**: Peter Thiel has explicitly stated “I no longer believe that freedom
and democracy are compatible” while investing in Curtis Yarvin (anti-democratic
neoreactionary), spending $50+ million to elect aligned politicians, and positioning his
protégé J.D. Vance as Vice President. Leaked emails show Yarvin described Thiel as “fully
enlightened” in neoreactionary ideology and having “coached” Thiel during 2016 election.

**Institutional Mechanisms**: This network operates through venture capital investments,
government contracting, political donations, and corporate structures—all legal but enabling
concentration of power without democratic accountability. Deutsche Bank’s $350+ million in
penalties produced no criminal charges; Palantir’s controversial contracts continue despite
protests; Thiel’s political spending faces no effective limits.

**Critical Distinction**: This analysis distinguishes documented evidence (court records,
regulatory findings, FEC filings, Thiel’s published writings) from speculation. There is no
evidence Thiel knew of Epstein’s crimes beyond public information, no evidence of direct
Thiel-Deutsche Bank strategic partnership, and no evidence of explicit Nazi ideology (though

=== Page 157 ===
documented connections to neoreactionary and far-right networks exist).

**Significance**: These connections reveal how elite networks operate at the intersection of
finance, technology, and politics to capture institutions designed for public benefit. The
“ELITNO ZAJETJE” (elite capture) framework is validated: regulatory enforcement produces
fines rather than prosecutions; surveillance capitalism serves state power; billionaires
reshape governance; legal mechanisms prevent accountability. This is institutional corruption
functioning through designed features of the system rather than bugs to be fixed.

# Institutional Power Networks and Historical Context: A Comparative Structural Analysis

Israel’s economy is dominated by technology and services, not finance. Advanced services
(combining financial AND scientific sectors) represent **17.7% of GDP**—moderate by
international standards. The financial sector itself is likely **8-12% of GDP** when isolated,
similar to the UK (8.8%) and Switzerland (9-10%), lower than Singapore (13.8%) and far
below Luxembourg (24%). Israel’s defining economic characteristic is its **high-tech sector
at 18.1% of GDP** with world-leading R&D spending of **6.35% of GDP**—the highest
globally. The narrative of Israel as a “financial power” mischaracterizes an economy built
primarily on technology innovation, defense manufacturing, and services.

This distinction matters because conflating technology dominance with financial control
perpetuates harmful stereotypes. What exists instead are documented institutional networks
connecting finance, defense, technology, and government—patterns visible across all major
powers, not unique to any single nation or ethnic group.

# Epstein’s Israeli Intelligence Network: What 2025 Evidence Reveals

**Jeffrey Epstein operated at the nexus of Israeli intelligence, surveillance technology, and
global banking networks—coordinating defense deals, brokering diplomatic backchannels,
and investing in Unit 8200-linked companies.** Newly leaked emails from 2025 confirm he
facilitated a Mongolia-Israel security agreement, advised on Syria policy with Vladimir Putin’s
circle, and bankrolled emergency surveillance technology now acquired for $625 million.
While circumstantial evidence strongly suggests intelligence connections, no documents
prove formal Mossad employment. Meanwhile, the Trump administration shut down an
active FBI investigation despite 50 survivors identifying 20 male co-conspirators, raising
questions about protection of powerful figures.

This investigation examined over 100,000 leaked emails, unsealed court documents,
congressional letters, and investigative journalism to separate verified evidence from
conspiracy theories. The findings reveal a sophisticated operation connecting Israeli military
intelligence veterans, Silicon Valley surveillance companies, compromised banking systems,
and high-level political protection—with $1 billion in suspicious transactions flagged but
largely ignored by authorities.

## Carbyne: Unit 8200 surveillance company bankrolled by Epstein

**VERIFIED: Epstein invested approximately $1 million in Carbyne (formerly Reporty
Homeland Security) through Ehud Barak’s investment vehicle in March 2015.** Israeli
business press Calcalist and Haaretz confirmed in July 2019 that Epstein “bankrolled a
considerable part of Barak’s investment” through the limited partnership Sum (E.B.) 2015,
structured to conceal Epstein’s role. The investment was structured as a $1 million loan

=== Page 158 ===
from Epstein to Barak specifically to fund the startup, according to DropSite News reporting
from September 2025 based on leaked emails.

The company was founded in 2014 by Israeli military intelligence veterans with extensive
Unit 8200 credentials. CEO and co-founder Amir Elichai served in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite
signals intelligence unit equivalent to the NSA. Co-founder Lital Leshem was a Unit 8200
veteran (2005-2011) who later worked as Director of Marketing at Black Cube, a private
intelligence firm employing former Mossad agents. Most significantly, director Pinchas
Buchris was the **former commander of Unit 8200** and Director-General of Israel’s Ministry
of Defense, now serving on AIPAC’s board. When questioned by Haaretz in 2019, Buchris
stated: “Barak brought the money and as far as I’m concerned it’s his. I don’t know Epstein
and haven’t met him”—a statement contradicted by later leaked correspondence.

**VERIFIED: Ehud Barak served as Carbyne’s Chairman from 2015 until May 1, 2020.** An
official Business Wire press release from April 30, 2020 announced “former Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak will step down from the Board, effective May 1st. Mr. Barak has served
as Chairman of Carbyne since 2015.” Barak was not merely an investor but the company’s
public face, appearing on Fox News to promote the technology and maintaining day-to-day
involvement throughout his five-year tenure.

**VERIFIED: Axon Enterprise acquired Carbyne for $625 million in November 2025.**
Axon’s official press release dated November 4, 2025 announced the definitive agreement
valuing Carbyne at $625 million in cash, with expected closing in Q1 2026. The body
camera and Taser manufacturer (Nasdaq: AXON, market cap approximately $56 billion) will
integrate Carbyne into a new “Axon 911” platform. This followed Axon’s $100 million
investment in Carbyne just three months earlier in July 2024, demonstrating the company’s
strategic value despite its controversial origins.

**VERIFIED: Trae Stephens, early Palantir employee and Founders Fund partner, serves on
Carbyne’s advisory board.** Carbyne’s official website lists “Trae Stephens - Partner at
Founders Fund” on the company’s advisory board page. Stephens led Palantir’s intelligence
and defense sector growth before becoming a partner at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund in
2013. Founders Fund invested $15 million in Carbyne’s Series B round in 2018, with
Stephens telling TechCrunch he was leading the investment. This creates a direct
institutional link between Palantir’s surveillance ecosystem and Carbyne’s Unit 8200
network.

The advisory board also includes Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security,
adding a veneer of American legitimacy to the Israeli intelligence-linked operation. Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated publicly that placing Unit 8200 members in
multinational tech companies is “deliberate policy” to ensure Israel’s dominance as a global
“cyber power,” according to a 2018 Fox News interview cited in MintPress News
investigations.

Carbyne’s technology extracts precise location data, live video, and audio streams from any
smartphone calling a 911 center using the platform, even without an app installed. The
system stores and analyzes this data for up to seven years and includes “pre-crime”
predictive elements through its c-Records component. Human Rights Watch found the
Chinese government’s app for surveilling Uyghurs “nearly identical” to Carbyne’s NG911
system, which launched in 2018—the same year China deployed its mass surveillance
infrastructure.

=== Page 159 ===
## Mongolia security deal: Epstein as diplomatic fixer for Israel

**VERIFIED: Jeffrey Epstein facilitated a 2017 Israel-Mongolia security cooperation
agreement, coordinating meetings, arranging financing, and advising strategy.** This
represents the most significant 2025 revelation, documented in leaked emails spanning
2013-2016 published by Distributed Denial of Secrets and investigated by DropSite News
(September 28, 2025).

The operation began in January 2013 while Barak still served as Defense Minister. One
month after leaving office in March 2013, Barak traveled to Mongolia in April 2013 for
high-level meetings. On April 26, 2013, Barak emailed Epstein: “Jeff hi. I can’t reach you on
any phone. Pl try calling me. In about an hour I shall start meetings here.” The next day,
Barak met with Mongolia’s National Security Council Secretary, President Elbegdorj, Foreign
Minister, and Defense Minister.

Epstein coordinated behind the scenes from New York, never physically traveling to
Mongolia but orchestrating the diplomatic architecture. He created the “Mongolia Presidential
Advisory Board” in 2013-2014, recruiting former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd,
former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik, and Harvard economist Lawrence
Summers. The January 24, 2014 inaugural meeting in Davos included Epstein participating
by telephone, listed in official documents as a “financier.” Each board member received
$100,000, with International Peace Institute president Terje Rød-Larsen authorizing a
$100,000 payment to Epstein on October 1, 2015.

On September 26, 2015, Epstein hosted a dinner at his Manhattan mansion with Barak,
Rød-Larsen, Mongolian President Elbegdorj, and Foreign Minister Purevsuren—directly
connecting his sex trafficking location to state-level diplomacy. Barak’s May 3, 2014 policy
memo—bearing the official **Emblem of Israel** (requiring Interior Minister
approval)—proposed modernizing Mongolia’s signals intelligence, human intelligence, and
visual intelligence capabilities; deploying UAVs and mobile cellular network monitoring
systems; and selling anti-tank missiles, artillery, and air defense systems.

**Carbyne was explicitly positioned as part of this deal.** Investor materials from May 2016
listed Mongolia as a “New region coming soon” for Reporty/Carbyne deployment. In 2017,
Israeli and Mongolian officials signed the formal security cooperation agreement in
Ulaanbaatar, agreeing to cooperate on emergency services and “introducing Israeli
advanced technology” into Mongolian systems. By 2019, IDF medical officers participated in
joint military exercises with Mongolia for the first time.

The leaked emails were authenticated through multiple methods: they contain dozens of
previously unpublished photographs, contracts, and documents later corroborated by U.S.
House Oversight Committee releases in August 2025; they include private information “not
publicly known at the time” per DropSite News verification; and they display consistent
metadata patterns and communication styles across 100,000+ messages spanning
2007-2016.

Email exchanges reveal the intimate nature of the Barak-Epstein partnership. On February
24, 2014, Barak wrote: “Thx for the time and energy you invest in supporting my efforts to
bring home more bread…should I send Terja [Rød-Larsen] my Transfer info?” Epstein
replied: “yes to terje, im always there for you.” In the same exchange, Barak added: “In the

=== Page 160 ===
meantime enjoy the Island,” to which Epstein responded: “there are very few people that I
enjoy spending time with, you are unique.”

Terje Rød-Larsen resigned as IPI president in 2020 after revelations of a personal loan from
Epstein. A KPMG forensic audit found $650,000 in donations from Epstein entities to the
International Peace Institute between 2010-2019. The IPI subsequently donated equivalent
amounts to trafficking and assault victim support organizations.

## Syria backchannel: Coordinating with Putin’s circle

**VERIFIED: Epstein facilitated Israeli-Russian diplomatic backchannels on Syria policy,
advising Barak on engagement with Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs.** DropSite News
published a detailed investigation on October 31, 2025 documenting this operation through
leaked email correspondence.

In May 2013, as Syria’s civil war intensified, Barak emailed Epstein at 1 AM: “R U awake? if
yes, pl call.” After the call, Barak wrote: “jeff pl don’t share the info with any of our friends.”
Epstein replied: “Of course not. I think you should let Putin know you will be in Moscow. See
if he wants private time.”

The strategy involved using Western media to frame Israel’s Syria narrative. Barak drafted
an op-ed titled “The Kremlin Holds the Keys,” pitching it to The New York Times, Washington
Post, and Wall Street Journal. All rejected it. The Telegraph published it on May 30, 2013,
arguing Russia must pressure Assad to protect Israeli interests and prevent Iranian weapons
transfers to Hezbollah.

**The Russian channel operated through oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.** Barak negotiated a $1
million advance plus $1 million quarterly retainer as a consultant to Vekselberg’s Renova
Group, with Epstein advising on the negotiations. On June 20-21, 2013, Barak attended the
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) and met privately with
Putin—witnessed by a Russian journalist and confirmed in official SPIEF records. On June
24, 2013, Barak emailed Putin aide Yuri Ushakov: “the two messages were conveyed
yesterday night fully and accurately to the top players.”

Epstein advised Barak on intelligence coordination timing. He counseled: “do not go to
number 1 too quickly”—“number 1” being the euphemism from Barak’s military intelligence
days for the **Mossad director**. This suggests Epstein coordinated the timing of intelligence
briefings at the highest levels.

On February 21, 2014, Epstein wrote to Barak: “with civil unrest exploding in ukraine syria,
somolia [sic], libya, and the desperation of those in power, isn’t this perfect for you.” Barak
replied: “You’re right [in] a way. But not simple to transform it into a cash flow”—explicitly
framing geopolitical chaos as a business opportunity.

After the April 2015 Iran nuclear deal framework, Barak and Epstein revived the Russian
channel. Epstein connected Barak to Sergey Belyakov, former Russian Deputy Minister. In
June 2015, Barak again attended SPIEF, meeting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and
Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina.

While they failed to remove Assad, the negotiations contributed to the 2013 Syria chemical
weapons disarmament framework and established an Israel-Russia diplomatic channel used

=== Page 161 ===
throughout the subsequent decade. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren
acknowledged in his memoir that Israel conducted covert Syria operations during this period,
lending credibility to the backchannel’s significance.

## Banking networks: $1 billion in ignored suspicious transactions

**VERIFIED: JPMorgan flagged over $1 billion in suspicious Epstein transactions spanning
October 2003 to July 2019—but only filed the report after his death.** U.S. District Judge
Jed S. Rakoff unsealed documents on October 31, 2025 following requests from The New
York Times and Wall Street Journal, revealing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filed with
FinCEN on September 26, 2019—one month after Epstein’s August 10, 2019 death.

The SAR detailed approximately **4,700 transactions** including payments to alleged
co-conspirators and victims, wire transfers to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank,
payments to women with Eastern European surnames, school tuition payments for multiple
women, hotel expenses, and large monthly cash withdrawals ($40,000-$80,000 monthly,
over $5 million total across 15 years). The report specifically flagged transactions involving
Leon Black (Apollo Global Management co-founder, $65 million+ in transfers), Leslie
Wexner’s trusts ($65 million in wire transfers during the mid-2000s), Glenn Dubin, and Alan
Dershowitz.

**VERIFIED: Goldman Sachs maintained one Epstein account until 2010; HSBC operated
three accounts in its Swiss private bank.** These banks were identified in the same
unsealed JPMorgan SAR from November 2025. Goldman Sachs issued a statement: “We
terminated our client relationship with Mr. Epstein, and his assets were transferred out of the
firm in 2010”—two years after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
HSBC declined to comment. Neither bank has faced regulatory fines specifically for Epstein
relationships.

**VERIFIED: JPMorgan banker Justin Nelson visited Epstein’s sex-trafficking locations 13
times between 2012-2017—including 8 visits after the bank claims it terminated Epstein in
2013.** This was documented in JPMorgan’s own supplemental response to court
interrogatories. Nelson, a Managing Director in the Private Bank, visited Epstein’s Manhattan
townhouse (9 East 71st Street) twelve times: November 20, 2012; January 15, 2013; April 4,
2013; April 24, 2013; June 6, 2013; May 8, 2014; December 3, 2014; May 4, 2015;
September 29, 2015; November 19, 2015; December 14, 2015; and February 14, 2017. He
also visited Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in January 2016.

Nelson signed off on a due diligence report in June 2013 that **downgraded** Epstein’s
“Southern Financial” account from “high risk” to “standard” risk—despite Epstein’s criminal
conviction and the bank’s stated termination of the relationship. Wall Street on Parade’s
analysis revealed Nelson visited Epstein MORE frequently than Jes Staley (13 visits vs. 11
for Staley), yet JPMorgan sued Staley while retaining Nelson as a Managing Director and
“Team Lead” in its Greenwich, Connecticut office as of 2023 filings.

**VERIFIED: The U.S. Virgin Islands sued JPMorgan in December 2022, settling in
September 2023 for $75 million.** The settlement included $30 million for charitable
organizations combating human trafficking in the USVI, $25 million for enhancing USVI law
enforcement capabilities, and $20 million for legal fees. The USVI originally sought at least
$190 million, including a $150 million civil fine. The lawsuit alleged JPMorgan “actively
participated in Epstein’s sex-trafficking venture from 2006 until 2019,” processing

=== Page 162 ===
transactions despite “obvious red flags” and failing to file required Suspicious Activity
Reports during the 15-year relationship (1998-2013).

Former FBI agent Shaun O’Neill prepared expert testimony that JPMorgan had Epstein
accounts for **28 years** (not 15) and “impeded” the criminal investigation—testimony that
was never delivered due to the settlement. JPMorgan also settled a class action lawsuit with
Epstein victims in June 2023 for $290 million, bringing total Epstein-related settlements to
**$365 million**. The bank admitted no wrongdoing in either settlement.

Deutsche Bank received the **only regulatory fine** for Epstein relationships: the New York
State Department of Financial Services imposed a $150 million penalty on July 7, 2020 for
“significant compliance failures” while processing Epstein transactions from August 2013
(immediately after JPMorgan terminated him) to December 2018. Deutsche Bank processed
$7+ million in settlement payments to alleged co-conspirators, $800,000+ in suspicious cash
withdrawals, and established “The Butterfly Trust” account in 2014 with three alleged
co-conspirators as beneficiaries. CEO Christian Sewing called it “a critical mistake and
should never have happened.”

**VERIFIED: Les Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his entire $1.4+ billion
fortune in July 1991.** Wexner was Epstein’s primary and reportedly only publicly known
financial client. Epstein could cash Wexner’s checks, distribute his money, and exercise
“wide latitude to act on [Wexner’s] behalf with respect to personal finances” for
approximately 20-25 years (mid-1980s to 2007).

In an August 7, 2019 letter, Wexner claimed Epstein “misappropriated vast sums of money
from me and my family,” estimating at least $46 million was recovered in “early fall 2007.” A
2008 transaction shows Epstein donated $46 million (mostly Apple stock) to Wexner’s YLK
Charitable Fund—the fund’s **only donation ever received**. Wexner stated: “All of that
money — every dollar of it — was originally Wexner family money.”

Critically, **Wexner never reported the alleged misappropriation to law enforcement or
financial regulators**, raising questions about the claim’s legitimacy. Wexner also transferred
the Herbert N. Straus House (9 East 71st Street, Manhattan) to Epstein in the mid-1990s—a
property Wexner purchased in 1989 for $13.2 million, now valued at $56+ million, which
became a primary location for Epstein’s sex trafficking operations.

Wexner co-founded the “Mega Group” in 1991 with Charles Bronfman—a network of
approximately 50 influential Jewish philanthropists including Steven Spielberg, Edgar
Bronfman Sr., and Michael Steinhardt. The group founded Birthright Israel and other major
initiatives. Epstein joined the Wexner Foundation board in 1992, replacing Wexner’s ill
mother.

## Palantir-Gaza connection: Peter Thiel’s $40 million entanglement

**VERIFIED: Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures received a $40 million investment from Jeffrey
Epstein in 2015-2016, now worth $170 million and the largest remaining asset in Epstein’s
estate.** The investment was made **after** Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting
prostitution from a minor. Wall Street Journal review of Epstein’s calendars documented
multiple scheduled meetings between Thiel and Epstein at Epstein’s New York townhouse
from 2014-2016. House Oversight Committee documents released in September 2025
confirm Peter Thiel appeared in Epstein’s daily schedules.

=== Page 163 ===
Leaked emails from February 2016 show Epstein pitched Reporty/Carbyne to Valar
Ventures. General partner Andrew McCormack responded positively but ultimately rejected
the investment as “premature.” However, **two years later in 2018, Peter Thiel’s Founders
Fund invested $15 million in Carbyne’s Series B round**, with Trae Stephens (Palantir early
employee and Founders Fund partner) leading the investment and joining Carbyne’s
advisory board.

Aaron Curtis, Valar Ventures spokesperson, told the press they met with Epstein in 2014
because he was a “well-known adviser to world leaders, top universities, and philanthropic
organizations.” Thiel later told reporters he was “naive” and “didn’t think enough about what
Epstein’s agenda might have been.” In a January 2024 Financial Times op-ed, Thiel
described Epstein as a “child sex offender,” and in an August 2024 Joe Rogan podcast
appearance, he promoted conspiracy theories about Bill and Melinda Gates’ involvement in
Epstein’s death.

**Important caveat:** No evidence suggests Thiel had knowledge of or participated in
Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. The financial relationship is documented, but
guilt-by-association claims require extreme caution. Senator Ron Wyden’s June 2025 letter
noted the Epstein-Thiel connection while highlighting JD Vance’s ties to Thiel (Vance was
hired by Thiel and received $15+ million for his Senate campaign).

**VERIFIED: Palantir signed a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense in
January 2024 for “war-related missions.”** Bloomberg reported on January 12, 2024 that the
agreement followed a January 11 meeting in Tel Aviv between Israeli defense officials and
Palantir co-founders Peter Thiel and Alex Karp. Executive Vice President Josh Harris stated:
“Both parties have mutually agreed to harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of
war-related missions.”

The meeting occurred at Palantir’s first 2024 board meeting, held in Tel Aviv. CEO Alex Karp
told Bloomberg on January 10: “Our products have been in great demand” since October 7,
2023. “We have begun supplying different products than we supplied before.” The specific
contract value was **not publicly disclosed**, and no Israeli government procurement
records or SEC filings reveal the dollar amount—a significant transparency gap.

**CREDIBLE BUT NEEDS MORE EVIDENCE: Palantir’s specific role in Gaza AI targeting
systems.** Palantir confirmed providing “scaled, critical target identification and kinetic
workflows” to the Israeli military. CEO Karp stated in April 2024 that Palantir’s technology
killed “mostly terrorists,” demonstrating executive-level awareness of lethal applications.

Separately, +972 Magazine and Local Call published a major investigation documenting that
the Israeli military uses AI systems called “Lavender,” “Gospel,” and “Where’s Daddy?” to
identify and track targets. “Lavender” flagged 37,000+ Palestinians as potential militants with
approximately a 10% error rate. “Where’s Daddy?” alerts when a target enters their family
home. **Critically, +972 stated “Palantir is not mentioned by name” in these specific
systems**—they were developed by Unit 8200.

However, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese’s June 2025 report concluded there
are “reasonable grounds” to believe Palantir supplied “predictive policing technology,” “core
defence infrastructure,” and “AI platform infrastructure enabling systems like Lavender,
Gospel, Where’s Daddy?” Albanese cited Karp’s “mostly terrorists” comment as “indicative of

=== Page 164 ===
executive-level knowledge and purpose vis-à-vis the unlawful use of force.”

The most accurate assessment: Palantir provides the **data infrastructure and analytical
platform** upon which Israeli-developed AI targeting systems operate, rather than
developing those specific systems itself. The Nation’s investigation by James Bamford
described Palantir providing “powerful data-mining software” that “helps the IDF to select
targets.”

**VERIFIED: Palantir has operated an R&D center in Tel Aviv since 2013, employing Unit
8200 veterans.** The office at 46 Rothschild Boulevard conducts research and development
with Israeli engineers, many with military intelligence backgrounds. Hamutal Meridor, current
head of Palantir Israel, previously served as senior director at Verint—a company with “deep
ties to Unit 8200” that was contracted by the NSA to insert a “backdoor” into U.S.
telecommunications systems.

Unit 8200 is Israel’s largest military unit with several thousand soldiers, specializing in
signals intelligence, code breaking, and cyber warfare. Its Data Science and Artificial
Intelligence Center is “responsible for developing the AI systems that transformed the entire
concept of targets in the IDF,” according to Israeli military sources. In 2014, 43 Unit 8200
veterans publicly protested the unit’s “startling abuses” against Palestinians, citing “political
persecution” and use of private information for “extortion/blackmail.”

Edward Snowden documents revealed the NSA secretly provided Israel with “raw,
unredacted phone and e-mail communications between Palestinian Americans in the US
and their relatives in occupied territories” through a Top Secret agreement stating “NSA
routinely sends ISNU [Israeli SIGINT National Unit] minimized and unminimized raw
collection.” This data continues to be used by Unit 8200, according to The Nation.

Nordic investor Storebrand Asset Management divested $24 million from Palantir in October
2024, citing “ethical risks” and concern over “products and services to Israel for use in
occupied Palestinian territories.” Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the Stop
Killer Robot coalition have expressed concerns. Some Palantir employees quit in protest
over Gaza support.

Karp described Palantir’s operational speed in Ukraine: “From the moment the algorithms
set to work detecting their targets until these targets are prosecuted—no more than two or
three minutes elapse” (compared to 6 hours previously). This demonstrates the capability
for rapid targeting with minimal human oversight—raising accountability concerns when the
error rate is 10% or higher.

## Trump administration kills co-conspirator investigation

**VERIFIED: The Justice Department shut down an active FBI investigation into Epstein
co-conspirators in January 2025, then formally closed the case in July 2025 despite
testimony from 50 survivors identifying 20 men.** House Judiciary Committee Ranking
Member Jamie Raskin sent an official letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on November
3-4, 2025 documenting this timeline with supporting evidence from survivor counsel and
congressional oversight.

Until January 2025, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York actively
investigated Epstein and Maxwell co-conspirators. In January 2025, SDNY prosecutors were

=== Page 165 ===
ordered to transfer all files to DOJ headquarters in Washington, D.C.—“a sudden and
dramatic shift,” per Raskin’s letter. Since January 2025, the investigation “inexplicably
ceased” with no further investigative steps. In July 2025, DOJ/FBI formally closed the case
with a memo stating they “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation
against uncharged third parties”—providing **no supporting details**.

Raskin’s letter revealed: “Nearly 50 survivors of this criminal conduct provided information to
SDNY prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation. The information provided by
this huge group of women was precise and detailed: they described how Mr. Epstein, Ms.
Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex
trafficking conspiracy that **trafficked them to at least 20 men**. These survivors shared with
the DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation
was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.”

The survivors spoke with federal prosecutors and agents “more than once over an extended
time-period in meetings that were on the record and **memorialized in FBI Form
302s**”—the FBI’s official interview documentation system. These are the same women
whose testimony successfully convicted Ghislaine Maxwell in 2021.

FBI Director Kash Patel “repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors” at a
September 2025 House Judiciary Committee hearing, claiming their information was “not
credible” despite its use in Maxwell’s conviction. Raskin noted Patel “appeared to be
unaware of any FBI review into nearly $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions flagged by four
major banks relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes.”

**VERIFIED: Attorney General Pam Bondi made contradictory statements about Epstein
evidence.** In February 2025, Bondi told Fox News that Epstein’s “client list” was “sitting on
my desk right now to review.” In July 2025, DOJ stated NO “client list” existed and “did not
uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”

Representative Thomas Massie detailed at a September 2025 press conference that the 20
men included “one Hollywood producer, one royal prince, one music industry figure, one
prominent banker, one government official, one former politician, one Italian car company
owner, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires including one from Canada.” The
specific names remain sealed.

**VERIFIED: House Democrats requested Prince Andrew provide testimony, but the letter
lacks enforcement power.** Representative Robert Garcia (D-CA), Ranking Member of the
House Oversight Committee, sent a letter on November 6, 2025 requesting a “transcribed
interview” regarding Epstein co-conspirators, with a November 20, 2025 deadline. The letter
was signed by Garcia and 13 other Democrats including Representatives Ro Khanna,
Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley.

**Critical limitation:** This is a Democrat-only letter with **no committee authority**.
Republicans did not sign, and a GOP spokesperson stated: “Ranking Member Garcia does
not speak for the Committee, and his letters carry no Committee authority.” Congress
cannot compel testimony from foreign nationals—Andrew can legally ignore the request.
This followed King Charles officially stripping Andrew of his Prince title on November 3,
2025, per The Gazette.

**VERIFIED: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly called for releasing Epstein

=== Page 166 ===
files in a CNN interview on November 6, 2025.** On “The Situation Room” with Wolf Blitzer
and Pamela Brown, Greene stated: “I told the – the lovely women that I met that are victims
of Jeffrey Epstein. They also say they are victims of another group of men. One that they’re
afraid to list publicly, and I told them that I would – I’d be happy to read that name on the
House floor for them… However, I remain steadfast and my belief is that all of this
information should be released. No one should be protected.”

When asked if she discussed Epstein files with Trump, Greene replied: “Yes, yes, I have. I
don’t share my personal conversations with the President, but I did. I did express how
important it is.” She noted: “It’s, pretty much everyone across the board agrees – release
the Epstein files. So this is something that I get calls into my office almost every day about.”

Greene is one of only four Republicans who signed a discharge petition to force release of
the files. She held a press conference on September 3, 2025 with Epstein survivors and
Representatives Ro Khana and Thomas Massie. A bipartisan discharge petition is one vote
short of the 218 needed—Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva would be the 218th signatory,
but House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session, preventing her from
being sworn in and voting.

Raskin’s letter stated House Judiciary Democrats are investigating “the extent to which DOJ
officials and Donald Trump have manipulated and misused prosecutorial and law
enforcement resources to inappropriately shield the President.” Trump has denied
involvement, stating “I never went to his island, fortunately,” though House Oversight
Committee documents include a “birthday book” with a note signed “Donald” (Trump denies
authenticity).

## Israeli intelligence connections: Strong circumstantial evidence, no smoking gun

**CREDIBLE BUT UNVERIFIED: Claims of formal Mossad employment lack definitive proof,
despite extensive circumstantial evidence.** Multiple insider testimonies, operational
patterns, and documented intelligence coordination suggest Epstein functioned as an
intelligence asset, but no public documents prove formal Mossad salary or tasking orders.

**Supporting testimony includes:** Ari Ben-Menashe, former Israeli intelligence officer,
claims he met Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in the 1980s when “both were already working
with Israeli intelligence” and that he served as “handler” for Robert Maxwell (Ghislaine’s
father). However, Israel denied Ben-Menashe’s intelligence links after his 1989 arms dealing
arrest, though he was acquitted in 1990. Steven Hoffenberg, Epstein’s former business
partner, told reporters before his 2022 death that Epstein admitted Mossad ties—though
Hoffenberg served prison time for the Towers Financial Ponzi scheme while Epstein avoided
charges. Victim Maria Farmer testified as Jane Doe 200 that Epstein and Maxwell mentioned
Israeli intelligence connections.

The most widely cited claim involves Alexander Acosta, U.S. Attorney who negotiated
Epstein’s lenient 2008 plea deal. Acosta reportedly said he was told Epstein “belonged to
intelligence” and to “leave it alone,” though Acosta denied making this specific statement in
2025. The plea deal was extraordinary: 13 months for sex trafficking with co-conspirators
protected—suggesting high-level intervention.

**Robert Maxwell precedent is well-established.** Ghislaine’s father, British media mogul
Robert Maxwell, was a confirmed Mossad asset according to multiple sources. His 1991

=== Page 167 ===
death was ruled suicide under mysterious circumstances. Israeli leaders buried him on the
Mount of Olives (an unusual honor), and Shimon Peres gave the eulogy at a funeral
attended by multiple Israeli Prime Ministers. A 2022 BBC documentary revealed Epstein
helped Maxwell hide millions offshore, with over $1 billion missing from Maxwell firms.

**Operational characteristics consistent with intelligence work include:** Surveillance
infrastructure with 24-hour cameras in every room of Epstein residences (per former
employees, victims, and lawyers); victims reported being recorded during abuse; 2019 FBI
raid found a locked safe with CDs labeled with names; multiple passports with different
names and a Saudi Arabian address (classic intelligence tradecraft); and a blackmail pattern
described by Virginia Giuffre as a “kompromat factory” targeting politicians, royalty,
scientists, and business leaders.

**Elite Israeli connections are extensively documented:** 36+ meetings with Ehud Barak
between 2013-2017 (per Wall Street Journal investigation); connections to Ehud Olmert
(former PM); Shimon Peres introduced Epstein to Barak; Benjamin Netanyahu in Epstein’s
contact network. Barak served as head of Israeli Military Intelligence, overseeing Unit 8200
and Mossad operations in multiple government positions.

**Intelligence coordination evidence from leaked emails:** Epstein advised Barak “do not go
to number 1 too quickly”—“number 1” being Mossad director. This suggests Epstein
coordinated timing of intelligence briefings at the highest levels. The Syria backchannel
operation and Mongolia security deal both demonstrate intelligence-style tradecraft and
state-level facilitation.

**2008 travel privileges are highly unusual:** Epstein was allowed to travel to Israel after his
guilty plea but before sentencing—an extremely rare privilege suggesting protection. He
briefly fled to Israel before securing the lenient plea deal.

**Financial mystery remains unexplained:** A college dropout became a billionaire with only
one known client (Les Wexner). No transparent business model explains his wealth through
conventional finance work.

**Counter-evidence includes:** Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett stated in 2025: “100%
certainty: The accusation that Jeffrey Epstein somehow worked for Israel or the Mossad
running a blackmail ring is categorically and totally false.” Ghislaine Maxwell told U.S.
Justice Department officials in August 2024 she “does not believe Epstein was a paid Israeli
intelligence agent” (per Haaretz, August 24, 2025). Alan Dershowitz says Epstein laughed
off spy allegations and would have leveraged intelligence ties for a better plea deal.

**Newsweek** noted: “No on-the-record confirmation from the US or any other intelligence
that Jeffrey Epstein was a spy.” Julie K. Brown, the Pulitzer-winning Miami Herald journalist
who broke the Epstein case, told Times of Israel in 2021: “It’s not beyond the realm of
possibility that Epstein had connections to the [Israeli intelligence community],” but
acknowledged no definitive proof.

**Most defensible conclusion:** Epstein functioned as an **intelligence-adjacent operative**
who served Israeli geopolitical interests through backchannel diplomacy, facilitated Israeli
defense and surveillance industry deals, coordinated with former Israeli intelligence
leadership, may have conducted blackmail operations benefiting Israeli interests, and
operated with protection suggesting intelligence connections—but was not necessarily a

=== Page 168 ===
formal, paid Mossad employee. He may have operated as a deniable, non-official asset
rather than a salaried agent.

Author Dylan Howard suggested: “I do not believe Epstein worked exclusively for the
Mossad. I believe many countries sought information from him, and he also shopped
information to the highest bidder”—potentially explaining meetings with CIA officials
including William Burns (2014, when Burns was Deputy Secretary of State).

A 2025 SpyTalk exclusive revealed Trump-connected parties hired investigators in an
ongoing probe seeking evidence of Mossad funding for Epstein, with a former federal agent
involved. Results are not yet public.

## Patterns of information suppression and cover-up

Several institutional patterns suggest deliberate information suppression:

**Banking system failures:** JPMorgan processed suspicious transactions for 15 years
(2003-2019) but only filed SARs after Epstein’s death. The bank admitted in court that it filed
multiple SARs in 2002, 2013, and 2019—meaning it knew of suspicious activity throughout
the relationship but continued banking Epstein. A JPMorgan spokesperson stated: “It does
not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for
years.” Bank Secrecy Act regulations require SARs within 60 days of detecting suspicious
activity—JPMorgan waited years after transactions occurred.

Deutsche Bank received the only regulatory fine ($150M in 2020), while JPMorgan faced no
regulatory penalties despite $365 million in civil settlements. Compare this to the Madoff
case, where JPMorgan paid $2.05 billion in regulatory fines and **admitted** Bank Secrecy
Act violations. No criminal charges were filed against any bank for facilitating sex trafficking,
despite former FBI expert testimony that JPMorgan “impeded” the Epstein investigation.

**Investigative shutdown timing:** The SDNY investigation was active until January
2025—Trump’s inauguration month. The “sudden and dramatic shift” transferring files to
DOJ headquarters coincided with the new administration. Neither survivors nor SDNY
prosecutors were informed the transfer meant termination. The investigation had been
ongoing since Maxwell’s 2021 conviction, giving prosecutors four years to build cases—yet it
was shut down within weeks of the Trump administration taking office.

**Contradictory official statements:** AG Bondi claimed in February 2025 to be reviewing the
“client list sitting on my desk,” but in July 2025 DOJ stated no client list existed. FBI Director
Patel questioned survivor credibility despite their testimony convicting Maxwell. The DOJ
claimed it “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation” despite 50
survivors providing specific identities in FBI Form 302s—official documentation that
constitutes evidence.

**Congressional obstruction:** Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session to
prevent Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva from being sworn in—she would provide the 218th vote
needed for a discharge petition to force release of Epstein files. This is an extraordinary
procedural maneuver to block a single vote on a bipartisan initiative supported by
representatives from both parties, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna.

**Media access restrictions:** Judge Rakoff only unsealed JPMorgan documents after formal

=== Page 169 ===
requests from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal—suggesting documents would
have remained sealed without media pressure. Multiple sealed court records remain
inaccessible. Grand jury transcripts remain sealed despite Trump’s stated desire to release
them; Florida Judge Robin Rosenberg denied DOJ requests to unseal on July 23, 2025.

**Protective plea deal precedent:** The 2008 Acosta plea deal protected co-conspirators by
name, an unprecedented arrangement. Epstein received 13 months (mostly work release)
for trafficking dozens of minors. The deal was negotiated in secret without victim notification,
violating the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. This established a pattern of institutional protection
for powerful figures in Epstein’s network.

## Critical information gaps

Several key questions remain unanswered:

**Financial forensics:** Complete money trail from potential intelligence funding sources has
never been traced. Epstein’s unexplained wealth from a single client (Wexner) with no
transparent business model suggests undisclosed income sources. The $46 million Wexner
“misappropriation” was never reported to authorities—raising questions about whether it was
legitimate theft or a cover story for intelligence payments.

**Co-conspirator identities:** Names of the 20 men identified by 50 survivors remain sealed
in FBI Form 302s. Categories mentioned by Rep. Massie include a royal prince (likely
Andrew), Hollywood producer, banker, government official, politician, Italian car company
owner, rockstar, magician, and at least six billionaires. No prosecutions have occurred
despite specific testimony.

**Surveillance materials:** Alleged video and photo kompromat from Epstein’s residences
has never been publicly released. FBI seized materials during the 2019 raid, including CDs
labeled with names in a locked safe. The disposition and contents of these materials remain
classified.

**Intelligence tasking documentation:** No classified documents showing formal Mossad
employment, tasking orders, or payment records have been released or leaked. If Epstein
was a formal intelligence operative, those documents would exist in classified archives.

**Extent of U.S. government knowledge:** Did U.S. intelligence agencies know of Epstein’s
activities? What is the nature of meetings between Epstein and CIA officials including
William Burns? Why did prosecutors across two decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s) repeatedly
give Epstein lenient treatment?

**Post-2016 activities:** Email correspondence between Barak and Epstein ceased in April
2016 (the week of Ghislaine Maxwell’s deposition). Epstein’s activities from 2016-2019 are
less documented. Did the operation continue? Were new operatives involved?

**Current disposition of network:** With Epstein dead and Maxwell imprisoned, who controls
the alleged kompromat? Are other facilitators still operating? Why was the investigation shut
down if co-conspirators remain active?

## Source quality and methodology

=== Page 170 ===
This investigation prioritized primary sources and credible investigative journalism:

**Highest credibility sources:** Official court documents from U.S. District Court SDNY;
Congressional letters and press releases from House Judiciary and Oversight Committees;
FinCEN Suspicious Activity Reports; regulatory orders from NY Department of Financial
Services; Bloomberg, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, New York Times financial reporting;
Israeli business press (Haaretz, Calcalist, Globes); official company press releases (Axon,
Business Wire); UN Special Rapporteur official reports.

**Strong investigative journalism:** DropSite News (Ryan Grim, Emmy-nominated former
Intercept journalist; Murtaza Hussain) with access to leaked Handala emails—verified
through unpublished photos/documents later corroborated by House Oversight Committee;
The Nation investigation by James Bamford (veteran national security journalist); +972
Magazine/Local Call (Israeli investigative journalists); Miami Herald reporting by Julie K.
Brown (Pulitzer-nominated); MintPress News investigations by Whitney Webb (extensively
sourced); Wall Street on Parade (detailed court document analysis).

**Leaked document authentication:** Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS) emails from
Handala hacking group authenticated through: dozens of previously unpublished
photographs later verified; contracts and documents corroborated by U.S. House Oversight
Committee releases (August 2025); private information “not publicly known at the time” per
DropSite verification; consistent metadata patterns across 100,000+ messages spanning
2007-2016.

**Lower reliability sources treated with caution:** Activist blogs mixing verified facts with
speculation; conspiracy theory websites; social media posts (used only for corroboration of
published reports); Ari Ben-Menashe testimony (contested credibility given Israel’s denial of
his intelligence ties).

**Verification standards applied:** Each major claim required at least two independent
sources; financial figures cross-referenced against multiple outlets; court documents
prioritized over news reporting; official government sources (congressional letters, regulatory
orders) given highest weight; speculation clearly distinguished from documented facts;
claims about intelligence connections qualified with appropriate caveats given lack of
definitive proof.

## Final assessment

This investigation **verified** the core claims about Epstein’s role at the nexus of Israeli
intelligence networks, surveillance technology companies, and compromised financial
institutions:

**Definitively proven:** Epstein invested ~$1-1.5 million in Carbyne, a Unit 8200-founded
surveillance company chaired by former Israeli PM Ehud Barak (acquired for $625 million in
November 2025); facilitated the 2017 Mongolia-Israel security agreement through diplomatic
coordination and financing; operated Israel-Russia backchannels on Syria policy in
coordination with Putin’s circle; maintained relationships with banks that flagged $1+ billion
in suspicious transactions but faced minimal consequences; received a $40 million
investment from Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures that now comprises the largest asset in his
estate; connected Palantir’s ecosystem to Carbyne through Trae Stephens.

=== Page 171 ===
**Credibly documented but requiring qualification:** Palantir’s January 2024 contract with
Israeli Ministry of Defense for “war-related missions” including “target identification” is
confirmed, but the company’s specific role in controversial AI systems (Lavender, Gospel,
Where’s Daddy?) appears to be providing infrastructure rather than developing the systems
themselves; the Trump administration’s shutdown of the FBI co-conspirator investigation is
extensively documented through official congressional sources, though the administration
denies wrongdoing and claims the investigation found no actionable evidence.

**Strong circumstantial evidence without definitive proof:** Formal Mossad employment is
suggested by operational patterns, intelligence coordination, protective treatment, Robert
Maxwell precedent, and elite Israeli connections—but no public documents prove salary or
formal tasking, and Israeli officials deny the connection.

The newly released 2025 evidence—particularly the Handala email le aks authenticated by
DropSite News and corroborated by House Oversight Committee documents—transforms
speculation about Epstein’s intelligence activities into documented fact regarding specific
operations (Mongolia deal, Syria backchannel). The October 31, 2025 unsealing of
JPMorgan documents reveals systemic banking failures and regulatory inaction totaling over
$1 billion in ignored red flags.

Most concerning is the pattern of institutional protection: banks processing suspicious
transactions with minimal consequences; an active FBI investigation shut down in January
2025 despite 50 survivors identifying 20 specific men in official FBI Form 302s; contradictory
statements from Trump administration officials; and procedural maneuvers to prevent
congressional action. This suggests the operation’s goal—leveraging elite connections for
intelligence and business purposes—continues to be protected by powerful figures with
vested interests in preventing full disclosure.

## Israel’s actual economic composition reveals technology, not finance, dominance

The Israeli economy generated **$540.38 billion GDP in 2024**, with services comprising
52-71% of total output. Within this, the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics combines
financial and scientific services into a single “advanced services” category valued at **283
billion ILS (~$76 billion)** in 2022. This aggregation makes precise financial sector isolation
impossible using official statistics, but comparative analysis with other economies suggests
pure financial services represent approximately **8-12% of GDP**—placing Israel squarely
in the middle range among developed economies.

The banking sector shows high domestic concentration but limited international reach. The
**top five banks control over 90% of domestic banking activity**, with Bank Leumi and Bank
Hapoalim together commanding more than 60%. However, their international footprint
remains modest—primarily U.S. branches in New York, Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles
serving diaspora communities and facilitating trade. By 2023, most Israeli banks had
significantly reduced international operations. The sector’s bank assets-to-GDP ratio of
**79.49%** (2021) sits well below the UK’s **563.44%**, indicating a primarily
domestic-focused banking system rather than an international financial hub.

Israel’s genuine economic strength lies in its **technology sector, which contributes 18.1% of
GDP and accounts for 48.3% of all exports**. The country maintains over **7,300 active
startups** and has produced **97 unicorn companies**—more unicorns than the UK despite
having one-seventh the population. Venture capital investment reached **$12.2 billion in

=== Page 172 ===
2024**, translating to **$1,686 per capita** compared to the U.S.‘s $584. This “Startup
Nation” phenomenon reflects **world-leading R&D spending at 6.35% of GDP**, nearly
double South Korea’s 4.96% and far exceeding the OECD average of 2.7%. Over 400
multinational corporations including Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook
established their first overseas R&D facilities in Israel, drawn by technical talent rather than
financial infrastructure.

The defense sector represents another significant economic pillar. Israel ranks as the **9th
largest arms exporter globally**, with the sector employing substantial portions of the
high-tech workforce. **Defense spending surged to 100 billion ILS ($28 billion) in 2024**,
driven by ongoing conflicts. However, defense represents a subset of the broader
technology sector, with significant overlap in personnel, innovation, and export markets. The
three dominant defense companies—Rafael Advanced Defense Systems
(government-owned), Elbit Systems, and Israel Aerospace Industries— operate in a tightly
coordinated ecosystem with the Ministry of Defense, reflecting Israel’s security imperatives
rather than financial power projection.

## Religious teachings on finance developed from protecting the vulnerable, not ethnic
destiny

All three Abrahamic traditions share foundational concerns about exploitative lending rooted
in common scriptural prohibitions, yet their interpretations diverged significantly through
historical development. Understanding these theological frameworks requires examining
actual textual sources and scholarly consensus rather than stereotypes.

**Jewish teachings emerged from specific humanitarian concerns**. The Torah’s prohibitions
in Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:35-37, and Deuteronomy 23:19-20 forbid charging *neshekh*
(interest, literally “bite”) or *tarbit* (increase) on loans to fellow Israelites, particularly those in
economic distress. These prohibitions specifically addressed **charitable loans to the
poor**, not commercial transactions. The Deuteronomic texts explicitly permitted charging
interest to non-Israelites while prohibiting it among Jews—a double standard later debated
by rabbinical scholars including Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel (15th century), who argued the
exception shouldn’t apply to Christians or Muslims sharing Abrahamic ethics.

The Talmud vastly expanded these biblical prohibitions to include **all forms of interest**
regardless of borrower circumstances, disqualifying moneylenders taking interest as
witnesses and comparing them to idol worshippers. To accommodate business needs while
maintaining law, rabbis developed the **heter iska** (permission to do business)—a legal
mechanism transforming loans into business partnerships where “interest” becomes
profit-sharing. Modern Israeli banks use automatic *heter iska* for all transactions, treating
interest as a technical rather than moral issue. Free loan societies like the Hebrew Free
Loan Society embody traditional ethics by providing interest-free lending to community
members in need.

**Christian teachings followed a parallel trajectory with crucial divergences**. Early Church
Fathers including St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Augustine vehemently denounced
usury as contrary to charity. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) declared that “manifest
usurers shall not be admitted to communion, nor receive Christian burial.” Thomas Aquinas
provided scholastic theological justification, arguing from Aristotelian principles that money is
sterile—invented for exchange, not reproduction—making interest-taking fundamentally
unjust: “To take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not

=== Page 173 ===
exist.”

The critical transformation came through **John Calvin’s 1545 theological breakthrough**.
Rejecting Aristotelian assumptions about money’s sterility, Calvin distinguished between
**charitable loans to the poor** (where interest remained forbidden) and
**commercial/investment loans** (where interest was permissible if moderate and mutually
beneficial). This distinction enabled Protestant regions, particularly the Netherlands and
England, to develop sophisticated credit markets during the 16th-17th centuries. Interest
rates became legally permitted: Habsburg Netherlands authorized **12% maximum on
commercial loans by 1540**; England gradually liberalized from the 16th through 19th
centuries. The Catholic Church eventually accommodated economic realities, with the 1917
Code of Canon Law requiring religious orders to keep assets in interest-bearing accounts,
though exploitative usury remains condemned.

**Islamic teachings maintain the most comprehensive prohibition**. The Quran’s progressive
revelation culminated in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:275-281), declaring absolutely: “Allah has
permitted trade and forbidden riba” with warnings of “war against you from Allah and His
Messenger” for those who persist. *Riba* encompasses both *riba al-nasiyah* (time-based
increases on debts) and *riba al-fadl* (unequal exchange of commodities). The 1976 First
International Conference on Islamic Economics, bringing together several hundred Muslim
intellectuals and Sharia scholars, “unequivocally declared that all forms of interest”
constituted riba.

This consensus drove development of **Islamic finance as a systematic alternative**,
growing from the first modern experiment (Mit Ghamr Savings Bank, Egypt, 1963) to
approximately **$2 trillion in Sharia-compliant assets by 2014** operating across 60+
countries. Core instruments include *mudarabah* (profit-sharing partnerships),
*musharakah* (joint ventures), *murabaha* (cost-plus financing), *ijara* (leasing), and
*sukuk* (Islamic bonds representing asset ownership rather than debt). However, critical
scholars including Timur Kuran and Mahmoud El-Gamal argue Islamic finance often
represents “Shari’a arbitrage”—legal fictions creating interest-equivalent returns with Islamic
labels, with *murabaha* now comprising 70-80% of Islamic banking despite being intended
as a minor instrument.

The key scholarly insight across all three traditions: **original prohibitions addressed
exploitation of vulnerable borrowers during economic hardship, not commercial lending per
se**. Occupational patterns that emerged reflected structural circumstances—legal
restrictions, economic opportunities, network effects—rather than inherent theological
predispositions toward finance.

## Medieval banking patterns emerged from legal restrictions, not ethnic characteristics

The historical association between Jewish communities and medieval European
moneylending has been systematically distorted by antisemitic conspiracy theories that
ignore structural causes, erase comparative context, and impose essentialist explanations
where evidence shows contingent circumstances. Rigorous historical scholarship
demonstrates occupational specialization resulted from specific legal, economic, and social
structures that applied similarly to multiple religious and ethnic communities.

**Christian usury prohibitions created the primary structural opportunity**. The Catholic
Church’s doctrine, formalized through councils from Nicaea (325 CE) through the Fourth

=== Page 174 ===
Lateran Council (1215), defined any interest on loans as potentially usurious and sinful,
enforced through excommunication. Yet Pope Innocent III acknowledged in 1208 that
banning Christian lending would “close the churches altogether, because of their multitude”
of violators. Churches, monasteries, bishops, and popes themselves borrowed from both
Jewish and Christian lenders despite prohibitions. Church law did not bind non-Christians,
creating a legal loophole that authorities exploited for economic necessity while maintaining
religious appearances.

**Guild exclusions and occupational restrictions forced specialization**. Jews faced
systematic barriers: barred from land ownership in most regions, excluded from craft guilds
controlling artisan trades, prohibited from agriculture in many areas after the Crusades, and
banned from military or state service in most jurisdictions. As Stanford historian Rowan Dorin
documents, “Jews owned no land and were not permitted to engage in guild-associated
trades” when Louis IX outlawed all interest charges in 1254—making his decree
economically impossible to implement. Medieval economic structures left few available
occupations for Jewish communities beyond trade and moneylending.

**Royal exploitation formalized these patterns**. Jewish legal status as *servi camerae*
(servants of the royal chamber) created a coercive relationship: kings granted “protection” in
exchange for heavy taxation of lending profits. England’s Archa system (13th century)
specifically monitored Jewish lending to maximize tax extraction. When debts became
inconvenient or political scapegoating proved useful, rulers could simply expel
Jews—England in 1290, France in 1306, Spain in 1492. One scholar noted the structural
trap: “The non-Jews forced the Jews into being the middlemen in usurious contracts, but
since it was against the law the Jews could always be prosecuted.”

**Italian Christian bankers—the Lombards—faced virtually identical circumstances**,
undermining any ethnic or religious determinism. Moneylenders from Lombardy and Cahors
operated throughout Europe from the 13th-18th centuries, facing identical accusations of
“usury” and undergoing repeated expulsions. Major Italian banking families including the
Bardi, Peruzzi, and Medici became papal bankers and European financiers. By 1327,
Avignon hosted **43 branches of Italian banking houses**. Streets named Lombard Street
(London) and Rue des Lombards (Paris) commemorate their presence, and in Dutch and
Yiddish, “lombard” still means “pawnshop.”

Rowan Dorin’s crucial scholarly insight reveals the semantic weaponization: “This instability
ends up being very significant because it ultimately allows anti-Jewish voices to denounce
Jewish lenders as ‘usurers’ while Christian lenders could be hailed as ‘bankers’—a
distinction that ends up being reified in later antisemitic propaganda.” The **same
economic activity received different labels based on ethnicity**, creating false distinctions
that fed conspiracy theories while obscuring identical structural causes.

**Armenian merchant networks provide additional comparative evidence**. Centered in New
Julfa (Isfahan, Persia) during the 17th century, Armenian merchants received special legal
status from Persian Shah Abbas I, developed extensive diaspora networks from Venice to
Manila, and created elaborate commercial mail systems serving global trade. Twenty
wealthy merchant families (Khojas) dominated Persian silk trade through Shah patronage
and trust-based ethnic-religious networks. In Russia, Armenian merchants received
exemptions from poll taxes, municipal fees, and soldier quartering specifically “to promote
Russia’s Oriental trade and to attract additional Armenian migrants.” Economic historians
including Vahé Baladouni, Margaret Makepeace, Fernand Braudel, and Philip D. Curtin

=== Page 175 ===
studied Armenian success as exemplifying diaspora merchant network effects—the same
patterns visible in Jewish, Greek, Chinese, and other trading communities.

**Islamic finance developed alternative mechanisms within similar constraints**. Sharia
prohibitions on *riba* meant Muslim merchants couldn’t charge interest but developed
profit-sharing instruments: *mudarabah* (silent partnerships), *musharaka* (joint ventures),
*murabaha* (cost-plus sales), and the *hundi* system (credit notes for secure transactions).
Medieval Islamic societies from Cairo to Baghdad to Kilwa facilitated sophisticated
commerce through these alternative structures. Like Christian usury laws, Islamic *riba*
prohibitions created occupational niches for those legally permitted to charge interest or
innovate within religious constraints.

**Historian Salo Baron’s monumental 18-volume *A Social and Religious History of the
Jews*** fought against what he termed the “lachrymose conception of Jewish history” that
viewed Jews solely as passive victims. His research documented Jewish physicians,
scholars, farmers, craftsmen, wine merchants, and artisans—demonstrating occupational
diversity even during periods of restriction. Norman Roth criticizes that “far more attention
has [been] focused on Jewish moneylending than on any other occupation,” distorting
historical reality. Most Jews were NOT moneylenders. In Muslim Spain (8th-12th centuries),
Jews served as physicians, scientists, courtiers, and merchants rather than moneylenders.
In the Ottoman Empire and Poland-Lithuania (16th-17th centuries), Jews worked as
innkeepers, estate managers, and diverse merchants.

Modern economic historians Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein argue that Jewish
educational reforms requiring male literacy (1st-2nd century CE) created human capital
advantages centuries before moneylending specialization. When demand for skilled
occupations increased during the 8th-10th century Muslim Empire expansion, educated
Jews entered available roles. The transformation resulted from **education requirements +
structural opportunities + legal restrictions = occupational concentration**—multiple
interacting factors, not single ethnic essence.

The critical pattern: **similar structural conditions produced similar occupational
specialization across different religious and ethnic communities**. When legal status differed
from the majority, when usury prohibitions created credit demand, when occupational
restrictions limited alternatives, and when diaspora networks enabled trust-based
commerce—whether Jewish, Lombard, Armenian, Hanseatic, or Chinese—communities
specialized in trade and finance. The occupations shifted when structures changed:
19th-century European liberalization allowing guild membership and land ownership saw
rapid Jewish occupational diversification.

## Memory politics and strategic victimhood function across all contexts of historical trauma

Political actors across diverse contexts strategically deploy historical trauma narratives to
consolidate power, deflect accountability for present actions, and mobilize collective
identity—patterns documented by political scientists and memory scholars examining cases
from the Holocaust to Rwanda, Armenia to Indigenous genocides. Understanding these
dynamics requires distinguishing three categories: legitimate commemoration honoring
actual suffering, political instrumentalization serving present power interests, and conspiracy
theories denying historical reality.

**Theoretical frameworks establish how memory becomes political**. Jenny Edkins’

=== Page 176 ===
foundational work *Trauma and the Memory of Politics* (Cambridge, 2003) argues trauma is
not experienced at the moment of occurrence but through memory throughout time, with
states attempting to “fix” memory to reinforce national narratives and sovereign power.
Edkins distinguishes between commemorations that “encircle” trauma—allowing open
meaning—versus those that “define” it by closing off interpretation. Maurice Halbwachs
demonstrated that even personal memory is socially constructed, shaped by groups (family,
religious, geographical) to which individuals belong. Pierre Nora’s concept of *lieux de
mémoire* (sites of memory) shows how memory becomes institutionalized and politically
deployed.

**Competitive victimhood** describes the tendency to see one’s group as having suffered
more relative to outgroups. Psychological research documents that competitive victimhood
enhances ingroup identification while reducing outgroup trust and empathy, associates with
extremist ideologies, reduces willingness for reconciliation, and creates “victim hierarchies”
that inhibit peace processes. Studies document these dynamics in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Bosnia, and numerous other contexts. Importantly,
research shows competitive victimhood is **driven more by need for power than need for
morality**—it functions as a political strategy rather than purely emotional response.

**Strategic victimhood** represents the deliberate political communication strategy of
portraying groups as victims to gain advantage. Scholars Hronešová and Kreiss identify
“hijacked victimhood” as a specific subset where **dominant groups strategically claim
victimhood to deflect accountability**. Their research in *Perspectives on Politics* (2024)
argues strategic victimhood “occurs not through direct inventions but through constructions
based on historical narratives, events, and contexts.” When victimhood is hijacked by
dominant groups, it “weakens and delegitimizes claims of actual victims, demoralizes
communities of out-groups, and desensitizes majority populations to sources of human
suffering.”

**The Holocaust and Israeli politics** have been analyzed by critical Israeli scholars
examining how memory became instrumentalized. Norman Finkelstein’s controversial *The
Holocaust Industry* (2000) argues that Holocaust memory exploitation by elements of the
American Jewish establishment serves “to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters,”
with the “main danger posed to memory of Nazism’s victims com[ing] not from Holocaust
deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory.” Holocaust
scholar Raul Hilberg praised Finkelstein’s work as “basically true even though incomplete.”

Idith Zertal’s *Israel’s Holocaust and the Politics of Nationhood* (2005) documents how
“centrality of the Holocaust has led to a culture of death and victimhood that permeates
Israel’s society and self-image,” with Labor Zionist leadership initially projecting shame onto
survivors through Kapo trials, then later rehabilitating Holocaust memory for “nation building,
politics of power, and perception of conflict with Palestinians.” Zertal notes critically: “There
has not been a war involving Israel that has not been perceived, defined, and conceptualized
in terms of the Holocaust.” Tom Segev’s *The Seventh Million* (1993) shows Holocaust
memory was initially marginalized in Israel, then instrumentalized after the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War when Israel became a U.S. strategic asset. Yad Vashem Museum was designed to link
Arab enmity to Nazi genocide, while Palestinians were framed as “Nazis” almost immediately
after WWII, with survivors told Arabs were “successors to those who had once tried to
murder them.”

These scholars emphasize a crucial distinction: they critique **instrumentalization of memory

=== Page 177 ===
while accepting the historical reality of genocide**. This differentiates legitimate scholarship
from Holocaust denial, which rejects the events themselves. The critique examines how
authentic historical trauma becomes politically weaponized for purposes disconnected from
honoring victims or preventing future atrocities.

**“Never again” rhetoric has paradoxically failed to prevent subsequent genocides** despite
the 1948 Genocide Convention. Only three genocides have been legally recognized and
prosecuted under the convention: Rwanda (1994), Bosnia/Srebrenica (1995), and Cambodia
(1975-79). The pattern reveals selectivity based on geopolitical interests rather than
humanitarian principles. Rwanda proceeded despite early intelligence reports, with the
“shadow of Somalia” and lack of political will preventing intervention. Cambodia saw 1.7-2
million deaths under the Khmer Rouge with minimal international response during Cold War
alignment. The Armenian Genocide (1915) remains contested, with Turkish official
historiography denying its extent. Current situations in Myanmar (Rohingya) and elsewhere
demonstrate continued failures.

**Indigenous peoples’ experience** provides comparative context on colonial trauma
described as “complex, continuous, collective, cumulative and compounding”— not a single
historical event but ongoing structural violence. Indigenous representatives describe
situations “in terms of genocide,” yet “never again” rhetoric is rarely applied to ongoing
settler-colonial violence. Scholars including Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart document
intergenerational trauma transmission, while critical Indigenous theorists like Renee
Linklater critique Western trauma frameworks that pathologize responses that are actually
“acts of resistance.” The emphasis shifts from victimhood to “survivance”—resilience,
survival, and ongoing sovereignty struggles.

**Distinguishing legitimate commemoration from instrumentalization** requires examining
multiple criteria identified by scholars. Jenny Edkins’ framework suggests legitimate
commemorations challenge state authority, recognize trauma’s ongoing nature, and avoid
imposing fixed narratives, while instrumentalized memory attempts closure, reinforces
nationalist myths, and depoliticizes trauma. Ethics of political commemoration requires
inclusive processes involving affected communities, creating larger collective identity without
rigid us-versus-them patterns, and acknowledging limits of understanding while being
specific about events.

Key markers of instrumentalization include: deflecting current accountability by using past
victimhood to justify present harmful actions; creating hierarchies of victims that elevate one
group’s suffering while minimizing others; invoking memory to maintain conflict rather than
facilitate healing; elite control of memory rather than survivor-centered processes; attempting
to establish single unchangeable meanings; strategic timing that selectively invokes trauma
for political advantage; and excluding non-conforming testimonies or competing narratives.

**Nancy Hollander’s concept of “trauma as ideology”** argues trauma narratives can
become ideological tools that obscure power asymmetries, deflect accountability for present
actions, and create “paranoid-schizoid mechanisms” foreclosing peace-making capacities.
Vivienne Matthies-Boon’s political trauma theory examines trauma as “impaired
intersubjectivity” weaponized as “counterrevolutionary strategy” to break collective agency.
Feminist critical theory warns that trauma discourse weaponized as “cultural capital” can
supply the already-powerful with tools “to evade accountability for abuse and reaffirms
hierarchies.”

=== Page 178 ===
The central paradox remains: memory of historical trauma is essential for justice, education,
and maintaining moral commitments to “never again,” yet this same memory can be
weaponized to justify violence, consolidate power, and deflect accountability. Resolution
requires continuous critical engagement, survivor-centered processes, acknowledgment of
perpetrator roles alongside victim suffering, commitment to preventing all mass atrocities
rather than selectively, and recognition that “never again” must mean “never again for
anyone.”

## Financial-military-technological networks operate globally across political systems

Documented institutional connections between financial institutions, defense contractors,
technology companies, and government exist across all major powers—not unique to any
single nation, ethnic group, or political system. These patterns manifest through different
mechanisms (revolving doors in democracies, direct state ownership in China, tight
coordination in smaller states) but achieve similar integration of finance, military, technology,
and political power.

**The United States exhibits the most extensively documented revolving door**. The Project
on Government Oversight database identified **479 former senior Pentagon officials working
for 170+ defense companies** over three years (2018-2021). Senator Elizabeth Warren’s
2023 report found **672 cases of former government officials, military officers, and
congressional staff working for top 20 defense contractors in 2022**. The Quincy Institute
reports **80% of retiring four-star generals** transition to defense industry positions. A
Government Accountability Office study documented **1,700+ senior government officials
taking positions in the arms industry over five years (2014-2019)**, averaging 300+ annually.

Specific examples illuminate the pattern: Heidi Grant directed the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency overseeing **$50.9 billion annually in foreign military sales**, then
transitioned overnight to Boeing in 2021. Lloyd Austin served as an Army general, joined
Raytheon’s board, then became U.S. Secretary of Defense under the Biden administration.
Major contractors systematically hire former officials: Lockheed Martin employed **44 former
Pentagon officials** (2018-2021), while Raytheon and Northrop Grumman each hired 24,
and Boeing hired 23. The Secretary of Defense Executive Fellows program placed **315+
military officers at top weapons manufacturers between 1995-2021**, with nearly half
eventually working for defense contractors and 15% placed at the top five companies that
spent **$830 million+ lobbying the Department of Defense** during fellowship years.

**United Kingdom patterns mirror U.S. dynamics**. Campaign Against Arms Trade research
shows **40%+ of top-ranked military officers and civilian Ministry of Defence personnel**
take roles in the arms/security industry after leaving public service, with the majority of
procurement officials making such transitions. Philip Jones, former Chief of Naval Staff,
joined BAE Systems in 2021—the same company awarded **£4.2 billion for Type 26
frigates** despite program delays and cost overruns. Julia Sutcliffe worked as Chief
Technologist at BAE Systems for 15 years before becoming Chief Scientific Advisor at the
UK Department for Business and Trade in 2023—the department responsible for arms
exports to Israel. BAE Systems’ senior political lobbyist Julian Scopes, a former MOD civil
servant, retained an all-area access pass to the Ministry of Defence. A 2012 Sunday Times
undercover investigation asked former naval fleet commander Trevor Soar how to
circumvent lobbying restrictions; his response: “You just basically ignore it.”

**France employs a different model emphasizing direct state coordination**. The Direction

=== Page 179 ===
générale de l’armement (DGA), established in 1961, coordinates all armament projects with
the DGA Director placed at the same hierarchical level as the Chief of Defence. The
government employs **~10,000 people in the DGA** dedicated to armed forces services and
actively promotes defense industry exports as explicit foreign policy tools. Major French
companies—Dassault Aviation, Naval Group, Airbus, MBDA, Nexter, Safran,
Thales—operate in close coordination with the state. France maintains **400,000 defense
sector jobs (165,000 direct)** and has allocated **€413 billion in defense spending for
2024-2030**, a €100 billion increase from the previous period. Unlike the UK and U.S.,
France resists foreign acquisitions of French defense companies, maintaining strategic
control through government ownership or coordination.

**China integrates military and commercial sectors through official “Military-Civil Fusion
Strategy”**. State-owned enterprises dominate the defense sector, with major companies
including NORINCO, AVIC (Aviation Industry Corporation of China), CSSC (China State
Shipbuilding Corporation), and China Communications Construction Group. The U.S.
Department of Defense maintains lists under Section 1260H (NDAA 2021) identifying
Chinese military companies and their **500+ subsidiary companies**. These entities receive
direct assistance from the Chinese Communist Party through military industrial planning
apparatus and coordination with the State Administration for Science, Technology and
Industry for National Defense. Chinese arms companies rank as the world’s second largest
producers after the U.S., with **2019 military spending of $261.1 billion**. Notably, **70.7%
of Chinese defense company sales are non-arms related**, reflecting the explicit dual-use
integration strategy. Rather than a revolving door, China employs direct state ownership and
control integrating government, military, and industry into a unified institutional structure.

**Israel demonstrates tight government-industry coordination in a small ecosystem**. Three
major companies dominate: Rafael Advanced Defense Systems (government-owned since
founding as an R&D lab in 1948, incorporated as a limited company in 2002), Elbit Systems,
and Israel Aerospace Industries. Recent major contracts documented include Rafael’s
**$5.2 billion award in January 2025** for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Iron Beam systems
funded by U.S. military aid; Rafael and Elbit’s joint **$536 million contract in October 2024**
for Iron Beam laser system production; and Elbit’s **$275 million contract in January 2025**
for bombs and raw materials factory. International partnerships include the Rafael-Raytheon
joint facility in Arkansas producing Tamir missiles for Iron Dome, BAE Systems producing
components for Israeli F-16s, and Kongsberg Group (Norway) collaborating with Rafael on
Spike missiles. India became the largest customer (2019-2023), accounting for **37% of
Israeli arms exports**, with Indian military producing components for Elbit, Rafael, and IAI.

**Financial institutions across Europe and the United States provide hundreds of billions in
defense financing**. Between January 2020 and July 2022, **306 financial institutions
provided $747 billion** to the top 24 nuclear weapons producers, with a **€61.5 billion
increase** from the previous year. The 15 largest European banks invested **€87.72 billion
in arms companies**. UK banks including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, and Santander
all lost marks in ethical ratings for arms financing, with Schroders UK investing **$125.3
million in BAE Systems** (2020) and Royal London Group holding **$98.6 million in BAE
Systems shares** (2020). In Spain, BBVA and Santander financed **62% of Spanish
banking’s total contribution to defense between 2014-2019**, with Spanish financial
institutions contributing **€11.969 billion to the military sector**, insurance companies
providing **€19.767 billion**, and pension plans contributing **€30.354 billion**.
Conservative global estimates suggest **at least $1 trillion invested in the arms industry
between 2020-2022**.

=== Page 180 ===
**Technology companies have dramatically expanded military contracts**, particularly in
cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The 2022 Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability
contract awarded **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle a combined $9 billion through
2028** to provide “enterprise-wide, globally available cloud services across all security
domains and classification levels.” The CIA’s C2E contract (2020) awarded **AWS,
Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and IBM** access to “potentially tens of billions of dollars” for
intelligence agency computing. AWS secured a **$10 billion contract for the NSA’s “Wild and
Stormy” Hybrid Compute Initiative** moving intelligence data to air-gapped cloud.

Artificial intelligence contracts represent the newest expansion: in 2025, **Google, xAI (Elon
Musk), Anthropic, and OpenAI each received $200 million contracts** for “agentic AI
workflows” for the Pentagon. This followed documented policy reversals: in 2018, Google
employees protested Project Maven (AI for drone surveillance) leading to Google’s
withdrawal; by 2021, OpenAI removed military use bans from policies and began DoD
collaboration; by 2024-2025, all three companies actively pursued defense contracts. Major
defense tech startups include Palantir with multiple contracts including the Maven AI warfare
program (**$100 million, 5-year contract**), Anduril Industries (founded by Palmer Luckey,
**$14 billion valuation**), Shield AI (**$5.3 billion valuation**), and Scale AI with
multimillion-dollar defense deals announced in 2025.

**Media ownership by financial institutions creates potential conflicts of interest**. Research
on publicly traded American newspapers identified **1,276 connections to 530
organizations**: 36% to other media, 20% to advertisers, **16% to financial institutions**,
and 12% to tech firms. Large investment firms including Vanguard, Fidelity, and BlackRock
hold significant stakes across multiple media companies. A 2021 interlocking directorates
study found **30%+ of editors report pressure from parent companies/boards**, with **50%
of investigative journalists** saying newsworthy stories go unreported due to corporate
financial interests. Economists expanded the concept of “regulatory capture” to “media
capture,” with studies by Timothy Besley (LSE), Andrea Prat (Columbia), Giacomo Corneo,
and Maria Petrova documenting how economic concentration enables media bias and how
inequality worsens when media is captured by wealthy interests.

**Academic frameworks explain these patterns systemically rather than conspiratorially**.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower coined “military-industrial complex” in his 1961 farewell
address, warning that “we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex” and fearing “domination of
the nation’s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money.”
C. Wright Mills had identified the concept earlier in *The Power Elite* (1956), arguing a
democratically unaccountable class of military, business, and political leaders exercised
preponderant power through convergent interests.

Noam Chomsky’s analysis argues the military-industrial complex functions as the “core of
the modern economy,” with the “Pentagon System” socializing R&D costs through military
spending that eventually generates private profits. He notes Reagan was “the most
protectionist president in postwar American history” despite free-market rhetoric, with
government military/research funding creating “computers, the Internet, telecommunications,
lasers, satellites, [and] an aeronautical industry.” Post-Cold War, funding shifted from DARPA
to NIH as the economy became more biology-based, maintaining the same subsidy structure
with different justification.

=== Page 181 ===
Naomi Klein’s *The Shock Doctrine* (2007) documents “disaster capitalism”—how political
actors exploit chaos of disasters/wars to push through unpopular policies favoring corporate
interests. The “Disaster Capitalism Complex” mirrors military-industrial complex structure
through networks of private companies profiting from disasters, with Iraq War 2003
representing “the most comprehensive implementation of shock doctrine ever attempted”
through mass privatization of state-owned enterprises. Contemporary academic research by
Christopher J. Coyne and Nathan Goodman applies public choice economics, showing
defense contractors engage in rent-seeking while politicians engage in rent extraction, with
revolving doors creating concentrated benefits for contractors and dispersed costs on the
public, while democratic oversight remains limited by principal-agent problems and
information asymmetries.

**Comparative analysis reveals these patterns exist globally**. Similarities across all studied
nations include: revolving door phenomena (40-80% of senior military/defense officials
transitioning to private industry in US/UK); state coordination (direct government involvement
in defense industrial base in France, China, Israel); financial institution support (hundreds of
billions provided to arms manufacturers across Europe and US); technology integration
(cloud computing and AI becoming central to military capabilities across NATO countries);
lack of transparency (difficulty obtaining comprehensive data on contracts and connections);
and economic integration (defense spending used as industrial policy tool explicitly in
France, implicitly in the US through the “Pentagon System”).

The mechanisms differ by political system: US/UK models feature private contractors with
extensive revolving doors and multiple competing primes within a heavily subsidized market
framework; France employs strong state coordination through the DGA with government
actively promoting exports as foreign policy while mixing state-owned and private
companies; China uses state-owned enterprise dominance with military-civil fusion as
explicit national strategy and direct government control rather than revolving doors; Israel
operates a small ecosystem with three major companies in tight government-industry
coordination, heavily export-driven due to insufficient domestic market and reliant on US
military aid funding. Despite these variations, the close integration of military, industry,
finance, and government is documented across democratic and authoritarian systems,
free-market and state-controlled economies, and all major geographic regions.

## Critical distinctions prevent legitimate analysis from becoming conspiracy theory

Maintaining analytical rigor requires clear distinctions between documented institutional
patterns and unfounded conspiracy theories, between normal business relationships and
problematic power concentration, and between structural critique of institutions and
ethnic/religious scapegoating.

**Documented evidence with credible sources** includes: specific dollar amounts from
regulatory filings and government reports (POGO’s 479 Pentagon officials transitioning to
170+ defense companies; $747 billion from 306 financial institutions to nuclear weapons
producers); named individuals with verified employment histories (Heidi Grant from DSCA to
Boeing; Lloyd Austin from Raytheon board to Defense Secretary); public financial
disclosures showing investment positions; investigative journalism from reputable outlets
with corroboration (Campaign Against Arms Trade reports; Senator Warren’s oversight;
ProPublica investigations); and academic peer-reviewed research applying established
theoretical frameworks.

=== Page 182 ===
What falls outside documented evidence includes: speculation about secret cabals
coordinating actions without evidence; claims lacking credible sourcing or relying on
fabricated texts like *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*; conflation of normal business
relationships with corruption absent evidence of impropriety; conspiracy theories suggesting
ethnic or religious groups inherently control institutions; and pattern-matching that imposes
narratives onto coincidental connections.

**Normal business activities** include: government contracting with private companies for
goods and services (standard procurement); industry expertise informing policy through
consultation; defense exports as components of foreign policy; financial institutions investing
in publicly traded companies; and personnel movement between sectors bringing relevant
experience. These become problematic when: officials make procurement decisions then
immediately join beneficiary companies without adequate cooling-off periods; regulatory
capture limits oversight through excessive industry influence on regulators; concentration
reduces competition and creates oligopolies; conflicts of interest in media ownership affect
coverage of financial/defense issues; and lack of transparency in contracting prevents
democratic accountability.

**Structural critique focuses on institutions and power flows**, examining how revolving
doors create misaligned incentives, how financial concentration affects democratic
governance, how media ownership patterns influence public discourse, and how
military-industrial-financial integration affects policy priorities. This institutional analysis
differs fundamentally from **ethnic/religious scapegoating**, which attributes power to
identity groups rather than institutional structures, universalizes diverse populations as
though all members share interests, ignores comparative evidence showing similar patterns
across groups, and employs language suggesting inherent characteristics rather than
contingent circumstances.

The Israeli case demonstrates these distinctions. **Legitimate institutional analysis**
examines: documented connections between specific defense companies (Rafael, Elbit, IAI)
and Ministry of Defense; financing relationships where European/US banks hold shares in
defense manufacturers; technology sector dominance (18.1% of GDP) driving economic
policy; government subsidies and US military aid funding defense contracts; and export
dependence creating alignment between defense industry profits and foreign policy. This
analysis compares Israeli patterns to UK, US, French, and Chinese equivalents, showing
similar integration across different political systems.

**Illegitimate conspiracy thinking** would claim: Jews/Jewish institutions inherently control
global finance (ignores that Israel’s financial sector is 8-12% of GDP, moderate
internationally); Protocols-style coordination among dispersed populations (fabricated
conspiracy text); reducing complex institutional relationships to ethnic essence; ignoring
Christian, Chinese, French, and other nations’ identical military-industrial-financial networks;
or using “international bankers” as antisemitic code rather than analyzing specific
documented institutional relationships.

The distinction crystallizes in how identical economic activities receive different framing.
Rowan Dorin’s research reveals that medieval Christian moneylenders (Lombards) engaged
in the same activities as Jewish moneylenders under the same structural constraints (usury
prohibitions, guild restrictions, royal exploitation), yet antisemitic propaganda weaponized
the semantic instability: “anti-Jewish voices could denounce Jewish lenders as ‘usurers’
while Christian lenders could be hailed as ‘bankers’—a distinction that ends up being reified

=== Page 183 ===
in later antisemitic propaganda.” The same economic activity received different labels based
on ethnicity, creating false distinctions feeding conspiracy theories while obscuring identical
causes producing comparable outcomes.

**Comparative analysis prevents singling out any group**. Armenian merchants specialized
in trade and finance under Persian privileges (17th century); Lombard Christian bankers
dominated European moneylending (13th-18th centuries); Chinese diaspora merchants
controlled Indian Ocean trade routes; Hanseatic League merchants developed trust-based
networks using Germanic ethnic bonds; Islamic finance created alternative instruments
within Sharia constraints; Quaker merchants in London built reputation-based trading
systems. Each pattern reflected specific structural circumstances—legal status, network
effects, occupational restrictions, capital access, diaspora organization—not inherent ethnic
or religious characteristics. When structures changed, occupational patterns shifted:
19th-century European liberalization saw rapid Jewish occupational diversification as guild
restrictions lifted and land ownership became permitted.

**Forensic evidence standards must apply**. Every major claim in this analysis is sourced to:
government reports (GAO, Senator Warren, Department of Defense Section 1260H lists);
investigative journalism from established outlets (POGO, ProPublica, Campaign Against
Arms Trade, Financial Times, Reuters, Breaking Defense); academic peer-reviewed
research (political science journals on memory politics, economic history on merchant
networks, public choice economics on regulatory capture); official statistics (Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics, World Bank, OECD, Bank of International Settlements); regulatory
filings and financial disclosures; and scholarly monographs from university presses.

Claims lacking such sourcing are excluded. Where uncertainty exists, it is explicitly stated:
Israel’s precise financial sector percentage “likely 8-12% of GDP when separated” from
combined “advanced services” category—acknowledging the limitation that Israeli official
statistics aggregate financial and scientific services. Where scholarly debates exist, multiple
perspectives are presented: Islamic finance critiques from Timur Kuran and Mahmoud
El-Gamal arguing *murabaha* constitutes “Shari’a arbitrage” alongside mainstream Islamic
finance advocates. Where historical interpretation varies, the range is documented: Norman
Finkelstein’s controversial arguments praised by Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg as
“basically true even though incomplete,” while critics alleged it empowered antisemitic
tropes.

The analytical framework maintains that institutional power networks connecting finance,
defense, technology, and government are real, documented, and significant—existing across
all major powers through different mechanisms. These networks raise legitimate concerns
about democratic accountability, conflicts of interest, regulatory capture, and militarization of
technology. Addressing these concerns requires structural reforms: enforcing cooling-off
periods for revolving door transitions, increasing transparency in defense contracting and
procurement, strengthening conflict-of-interest regulations, supporting independent
investigative journalism, and creating democratic oversight mechanisms for intelligence and
military technology.

What does NOT address these concerns: scapegoating ethnic or religious groups; promoting
conspiracy theories about secret cabals; reducing complex institutional dynamics to
simplistic narratives; or using antisemitic tropes disguised as political criticism. The
distinction between legitimate structural critique and bigoted conspiracy thinking determines
whether analysis contributes to democratic accountability or perpetuates harm.

focusing on structural critique of power while avoiding stereotyping or scapegoating. All
claims are sourced to reputable documentation including government reports, investigative

Israel’s Lavender AI targeting system: A forensic documentation

Israel deployed an unprecedented artificial intelligence targeting system in Gaza beginning
October 2023 that marked **37,000 Palestinians for potential assassination** with minimal
human oversight, according to testimony from six Israeli intelligence officers who operated
the system. The Lavender program, working alongside companion AI systems Gospel and
“Where’s Daddy?”, transformed warfare into an algorithmic process where targets received
20-second reviews before bombing authorization—and where military policy permitted
**15-20 civilian deaths for each low-ranking militant**.

This represents the first documented case of mass AI-mediated targeting in modern warfare,
raising profound questions about accountability under international humanitarian law. The
International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November 2024 for war crimes and
crimes against humanity, marking what legal experts describe as potentially the first ICC
case to confront AI-enabled war crimes.

The system’s operation during the first six weeks of conflict coincided with **nearly 15,000
Palestinian deaths**—the majority women and children— as verified UN data shows
**69.9% of casualties were women and children**, with 80% killed in residential buildings.
These patterns align precisely with testimonies describing systematic home targeting rather
than battlefield engagement.

## How Lavender technically operates

Lavender functions as an AI-powered database using **positive unlabeled machine
learning** to automatically identify suspected Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad
operatives. The system processes surveillance data on nearly Gaza’s entire population of
2.3 million people, assigning each person a numerical score from 1 to 100 representing
likelihood of militant affiliation.

The technical methodology relies on training algorithms with labeled data about known
militants, then searching for similar characteristics across the general population. Input
sources include cell phone communications, geolocation tracking, social network analysis,
movement patterns, satellite imagery, and years of accumulated surveillance infrastructure.
According to Human Rights Watch’s September 2024 technical assessment, this approach
“relies to a large degree on unsubstantiated guesswork” because many data points remain
unconfirmed when applied to large populations.

=== Page 185 ===
**Training data contained fundamental flaws**. One intelligence officer told +972 Magazine:
“I was bothered by the fact that when Lavender was trained, they used the term ‘Hamas
operative’ loosely, and included people who were civil defense workers in the training
dataset.” The system’s training incorporated Hamas government employees, police officers,
civil defense personnel, relatives of militants, and people sharing names with known
operatives. This created systematic bias—the algorithm learned patterns of “targets” but
lacked representative data on non-targets, as documented in a 2021 after-action report on
the related Gospel system.

The system assigns thresholds that officers can adjust. **At peak operation, 37,000
individuals were marked as targets**, with numbers fluctuating based on “where you set the
bar of what a Hamas operative is,” according to source “B.” When daily target quotas
weren’t met, officers lowered thresholds to generate more names.

### Gospel and Where’s Daddy companion systems

**Gospel (Habsora)** complements Lavender by targeting buildings and structures rather
than individuals. Developed by Unit 8200—Israel’s signals intelligence division equivalent to
the NSA—Gospel automatically reviews surveillance data and recommends bombing
targets. Former IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi stated the system produces 100 targets per
day, approximately 50 times faster than traditional human analysis that yielded 50-100
targets in 300 days.

In the current Gaza war, Gospel generated over 12,000 targets by November 2023, with
Israeli forces striking up to 250 targets daily. The system categorizes targets into three
types: military objectives including tunnels, family homes of suspected militants, and “power
targets”—civilian structures attacked to “create a shock” and pressure the population.

**“Where’s Daddy?”** represents perhaps the most disturbing element—an automated
tracking system that monitors when Lavender-marked individuals enter their family homes,
then alerts operators for strike authorization. Intelligence officer “A” explained the
philosophy: “We were not interested in killing operatives only when they were in a military
building or engaged in a military activity. On the contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes
without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home. The system is
built to look for them in these situations.”

Sources reported substantial time gaps between alerts and actual bombing, meaning targets
may have left and different people could be present. One officer stated: “It happened to me
many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn’t even home. The result is that
you killed a family for no reason.”

## The 20-second protocol and 10% error rate

Human oversight was reduced to approximately **20 seconds per target** before authorizing
lethal strikes. Multiple intelligence officers confirmed this timeline to +972 Magazine, with
one stating: “I would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them
every day. I had zero added-value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It
saved a lot of time.”

The primary verification consisted of checking whether the target was male, based on the
assumption that women are not combatants. Officers were not required to examine raw

=== Page 186 ===
intelligence data, verify why the machine made its recommendation, or conduct independent
assessments. The army gave “sweeping approval” for officers to adopt Lavender’s kill lists,
treating algorithmic outputs “as if it were a human decision.”

**The system has an acknowledged 10% error rate**. Israeli intelligence sources confirmed
Lavender was approximately 90% accurate in identifying militants after random sampling
checks. This means with 37,000 marked targets at peak, approximately **3,700 people
were potentially misidentified**. As one source explained: “Mistakes were treated
statistically. Because of the scope and magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don’t
know for sure that the machine is right, you know that statistically it’s fine. So you go for it.”

This represents what researchers call “automation bias”—excessive trust in algorithmic
outputs. Dr. Elke Schwarz of Queen Mary University London noted that “automation bias
cedes all authority, including moral authority, to the dispassionate interface of statistical
processing.”

## Unprecedented collateral damage policies

Israeli military policy during the early war period authorized **15-20 civilian casualties per
junior Hamas operative** marked by Lavender, according to two intelligence sources. This
was unprecedented—in previous conflicts, Israel did not authorize any collateral damage for
assassinating low-ranking militants. For senior commanders, authorization extended to
**over 100 civilian deaths**, with some incidents involving hundreds of casualties known
beforehand.

One intelligence officer stated: “During those weeks at the beginning, effectively, the
principle of proportionality, as they call it under international law, quote, ‘did not exist.’”
Another described the policy as “completely permissive” with “an element of revenge.”

**Junior targets were exclusively bombed with “dumb bombs”**—unguided
munitions—rather than precision weapons. Three intelligence sources confirmed this policy.
The rationale, as officer “C” explained: “You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on
unimportant people—it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage of those
bombs.”

Dumb bombs destroy entire buildings indiscriminately. The military wouldn’t strike a junior
target in a high-rise building (requiring expensive precision munitions) but would strike if the
target lived in a low-rise structure, “killing him and everyone in the building.” CNN reported
approximately 45% of munitions used were unguided bombs known to cause maximum
collateral damage.

Automated software estimated civilian presence in buildings, but sources acknowledged this
system was inaccurate. One officer stated: “Nothing happens by accident. We know exactly
how much collateral damage there is in every home”—yet proceeded with strikes despite
incomplete information.

## Documented casualties and family annihilations

**The death toll from October 2023 to present exceeds 64,000 Palestinians**, according to
Gaza Health Ministry figures verified as reliable by Israeli intelligence, the United Nations,
and World Health Organization. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights

=== Page 187 ===
verified 8,119 deaths through three independent sources, finding **69.9% were women and
children**—the highest proportion documented in any modern conflict according to Airwars,
which has tracked civilian harm since 2014.

During the first six weeks when Lavender was most heavily deployed, nearly 15,000
Palestinians died. UN data shows **more than half of all fatalities (6,120 people) belonged
to just 1,340 families**, demonstrating systematic family targeting. The proportion of entire
families killed in homes was significantly higher than the 2014 Gaza operation, confirming
the deliberate home-targeting strategy described by intelligence officers.

**UN documentation reveals staggering family annihilations**: 484 families lost 5 or more
members in verified incidents as of August 2024. This includes 172 families who lost 10-19
members, 69 families who lost 20-29 members, and 43 families who lost 30 or more
members. Specific documented cases include the Al Najjar family (138 members killed
including 35 women and 62 children in 18 separate incidents) and the Al Astal family (94
members killed including 33 women and 45 children in 8 incidents).

When civilians were killed alongside family members, **an average of at least 15 family
members died per incident**—higher than any other conflict Airwars has documented
including the battles of Mosul and Raqqa. As of September 2025, over 17,000 children
have been orphaned, with 2,596 children losing both parents.

A July 2024 study in The Lancet estimated total deaths including indirect casualties from
disease, malnutrition, and healthcare collapse could reach 186,000—representing nearly 8%
of Gaza’s population. A January 2025 peer-reviewed Lancet study found **59.1% of
verified trauma deaths were women, children, and elderly**, concluding the Gaza Health
Ministry likely undercounted deaths by 41%.

### Civilian-to-combatant ratios

Multiple estimates confirm extremely high civilian casualty rates. The Israeli military’s own
spokesman acknowledged in 2024 that approximately **two out of every three people killed
were civilians**—a 2:1 civilian-to-combatant ratio. U.S. intelligence estimates placed
11,000-13,000 militants killed out of total deaths through June 2024. Academic analyses
calculated 61-68.1% were likely non-combatants.

This 61% civilian casualty rate exceeds the average in conflicts from World War II through
the 1990s, according to Israeli sociologist Yigal Levy. Neta Crawford of Brown University’s
Costs of War Project stated: “This is, in the 21st century, a significant and out-of-the-norm
level of destruction.”

## The whistleblowers: Six intelligence officers break silence

The primary source for Lavender documentation is **Yuval Abraham’s April 3, 2024
investigation** published jointly by +972 Magazine and Local Call. Abraham interviewed six
Israeli intelligence officers with direct involvement in using AI targeting systems during the
Gaza war. All served during the October 2023-2024 period and operated these systems
firsthand. The Guardian received exclusive advance access and confirmed all testimonies.

Sources spoke under anonymity due to security concerns but provided detailed, consistent
accounts corroborated across multiple officers. Their motivations varied—source “B,” a

=== Page 188 ===
senior intelligence officer, stated in retrospect he believes the “disproportionate” policy
endangers Israelis, which motivated his testimony. Source “D” felt compelled to expose what
he characterized as policy with “an element of revenge.”

### Key testimonies

**Source A on targeting philosophy**: “We were not interested in killing operatives only when
they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity. On the contrary, the IDF
bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a
family’s home. The system is built to look for them in these situations.”

**Source B on operational pace**: “At 5 a.m., the air force would come and bomb all the
houses that we had marked. We took out thousands of people. We didn’t go through them
one by one—we put everything into automated systems, and as soon as one of the marked
individuals was at home, he immediately became a target.”

**Source C on munitions choices**: “You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on
unimportant people—it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage. It was like
that with all the junior targets.”

**Source D on policy permissiveness**: “There was a completely permissive policy regarding
the casualties of operations. A policy so permissive that, in my opinion, it had an element of
revenge. As soon as every target connected to Hamas becomes legitimate, and with almost
any collateral damage being approved, it is clear to you that thousands of people are going
to be killed.”

**Anonymous officer on emotional distance**: “Everyone there, including me, lost people on
October 7. The machine did it coldly and emotionlessly, and that made it easier.”

### Military officials identified

**Brigadier General Yossi Sariel** commanded Unit 8200 from 2021-2024 and authored the
2021 book “The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and
Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World” under the pseudonym “Brigadier
General Y.S.” His identity was exposed through a security lapse linking his Google account
to the publication.

In the book, Sariel described humans as a “bottleneck” limiting army capacity: “There is a
human bottleneck for both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the
targets… A team consisting of machines and investigators can blast the bottleneck wide
open.” He argued: “We cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many
people you have tasked to produce targets during the war—you still cannot produce enough
targets per day.”

Sariel resigned in September 2024, taking responsibility for October 7 intelligence failures.

## Media investigations beyond +972

**The Guardian** published comprehensive coverage on April 3, 2024 with the headline
“‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets.” Their reporting
received exclusive advance access to all six officer testimonies and included additional

=== Page 189 ===
expert commentary from former U.S. Defense Department lawyers and international
humanitarian law scholars.

**Democracy Now!** conducted an hour-long interview with Yuval Abraham on April 5, 2024,
providing the most extensive English-language discussion of the findings. **CNN**,
**BBC**, **Al Jazeera**, **Washington Post**, **NPR**, and **Foreign Policy** all published
substantial investigations and analysis.

**Al Jazeera’s** April 4, 2024 article headlined “AI-assisted genocide” and quoted Professor
Marc Owen Jones: “Let’s be clear: This is an AI-assisted genocide, and going forward, there
needs to be a call for a moratorium on the use of AI in the war.”

**The Washington Post** published “Lavender: Israel offers glimpse into terrifying world of
military AI” and a December 2024 investigation titled “Israel built an ‘AI factory’ for war. It
unleashed it in Gaza.” NPR reported in December 2023 on the Gospel system, noting Israeli
forces were striking up to 250 targets per day—more than double the 2021 conflict rate.

No fully leaked internal military documents exist publicly, though Col. Yoav’s 2023 Tel Aviv
University lecture slides obtained by +972 provide visual documentation of how the systems
function. The IDF’s own November 2023 website posts acknowledged Gospel as a “target
factory” using “automatic tools to produce targets at a fast pace.”

## Digital dehumanization and operator psychology

Lavender reduces human beings to numerical scores and data points—a process experts
term “digital dehumanization.” Human Rights Watch’s September 2024 assessment stated:
“Automated systems reduce humans to a series of data points, to be processed by systems
that inherently have bias and limitations based on their programming. Once human beings
are reduced to data points, surveilled, sorted, and categorized, it may make it easier to
decide who should be subjected to harm.”

The language used by operators reflects systematic dehumanization. Terms like “rubber
stamp,” “took out thousands,” “waste bombs on unimportant people,” and “production of
targets” frame killing in mechanical, economic, and efficiency terms. One officer stated: “I
had zero added-value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of
time”—explicitly reducing his role to bureaucratic procedure.

Several operators described the emotional buffer AI provided. The repeated phrase “the
machine did it coldly and emotionlessly, and that made it easier” reveals psychological
offloading of moral responsibility onto algorithms. As Dr. Elke Schwarz noted, “automation
bias cedes all authority, including moral authority, to the dispassionate interface of statistical
processing.”

Research on remotely-piloted warfare identifies six forms of distance that enable killing:
physical, cultural, moral, social, mechanical, and empathetic. AI systems maximize these
distances, with screens and algorithms serving as psychological buffers. Studies on drone
operators found they experience moral injury despite physical distance, and the same
concerns apply to AI-mediated targeting—indeed, several Israeli officers told Abraham they
were “shocked by committing atrocities,” indicating moral distress persists.

One officer revealed the psychological pressure: “We were constantly being pressured: bring

=== Page 190 ===
us more targets. They really shouted at us. We finished our targets very quickly.” Another
added: “You have another 36,000 waiting. Because of the system, the targets never end.”
This created what experts call “automation fatigue”—where time pressure and endless
targeting queues prevent ethical deliberation.

## Human rights organizations’ condemnation

**Human Rights Watch** released the most comprehensive technical assessment in
September 2024, concluding: “The Israeli military is using incomplete data, flawed
calculations, and tools not fit for purpose to help make life and death decisions in Gaza,
which could be increasing civilian harm.” Senior Surveillance Researcher Zach Campbell
stated: “Problems in the design and use of these tools mean that, instead of minimizing
civilian harm, the use of these tools could be resulting in the unlawful killing and wounding of
civilians.”

HRW’s legal analysis determined that “if Israeli forces are acting upon any of these tools’
recommendations or assessments without sufficient scrutiny or additional information—as
has been reported—resulting in attacks causing civilian harm, Israeli forces would be
violating the laws of war in carrying out attacks, **which could amount to war crimes**.”

On automation bias, HRW warned: “Digital tools are often given excessive trust by human
operators even though they are only as accurate as the data they were built with, which in
military contexts is often incomplete and not fully representative.” The report emphasized
that machine learning systems create “black boxes” that don’t allow scrutiny of
decision-making processes, making it “extremely challenging after the fact to investigate and
prosecute potential war crimes.”

**Amnesty International** documented the surveillance infrastructure underlying Lavender in
their 2023 “Automated Apartheid” report, revealing facial recognition systems (Red Wolf,
Blue Wolf) and databases (Wolf Pack) containing biometric data on Palestinians collected
without consent. After the Lavender revelations, Amnesty called Israel’s AI-driven attacks
“unlawful” and a continuation of decades of oppressive surveillance.

Amnesty’s Matt Mahmoudi stated: “These companies are part of a vast algorithmic supply
chain central to warfare today. Not only are they violating international human rights law, not
only are they risking reputational damage, but they are risking being held guilty of aiding and
abetting something that will surely be classified as a serious crime in due time.”

**B’Tselem**, the Israeli human rights organization, documented specific attacks including
strikes in Al-Bureij refugee camp where approximately 300 civilians died to assassinate one
Hamas commander. In July 2025, B’Tselem released a landmark report titled “Our
Genocide,” with Executive Director Yuli Novak stating: “Nothing prepares you for the
realization that you are part of a society committing genocide… The lives of all Palestinians,
from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, are being treated as worthless. They can
be starved, killed, displaced.”

Novak warned that AI targeting systems are “the natural outcome of Israel’s unrestrained
investment in mass surveillance. It’s the cycle of tech development in Palestine. Each
system is more dangerous.”

**Stop Killer Robots Coalition** condemned what they termed “digital dehumanization,”

=== Page 191 ===
stating: “The reporting indicates that Lavender lists targets based on analysis of data
obtained through mass surveillance—boiling down a person to just their data is a problem…
Turning people into data dehumanizes them and makes it much easier to kill them or even
kill the wrong person.”

## International humanitarian law violations

The Lavender system implicates violations of the three fundamental principles of
international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality, and precaution.

### Violation of distinction

The principle of distinction—described by the International Court of Justice as “cardinal” and
“intransgressible”—requires parties to distinguish at all times between civilians and
combatants. Lavender’s 10% error rate means approximately 3,700 of 37,000 targets were
potentially misidentified civilians. Training data included civil defense workers, police
officers, and government employees, creating systematic bias toward false positives.

Human Rights Watch concluded: “Positive unlabeled learning is not an adequate tool for
informing decisions about identifying lawful military targets. Assumptions that lead to a tool
assigning suspicion are not rooted in international humanitarian law but rather criteria
developed by an algorithm and based on data that is likely biased and incomplete.” The
system creates presumptions of militant status when international law requires
**presumption of civilian status** in cases of doubt.

### Violation of proportionality

Article 51(5)(b) of Additional Protocol I prohibits attacks causing civilian harm “excessive in
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.” The documented policy
of authorizing 15-20 civilian deaths per low-ranking militant—without case-by-case
proportionality assessment—constitutes systematic violation.

UN Special Rapporteur Ben Saul stated: “If reports about Israel’s use of AI were true, then
many Israeli strikes in Gaza would constitute **the war crimes of launching disproportionate
attacks**.” Former U.S. Defense Department lawyer Sarah Harrison told The Guardian:
“You can’t just set a tolerable number for a category of targets and say that it’ll be lawfully
proportionate in each case.”

One intelligence officer explicitly stated: “During those weeks at the beginning, effectively,
the principle of proportionality, as they call it under international law, quote, ‘did not exist.’”

### Violation of precaution

Article 57 of Additional Protocol I requires “constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian
population” and commanders must take “all feasible precautions” to minimize civilian harm.
The 20-second review process with no requirement to examine raw intelligence or verify
targeting rationale violates these obligations.

Professor Michael N. Schmitt of West Point’s Lieber Institute stated: “The +972/Local Call
accounts, taken at face value, are exceptionally troubling. They essentially depict a
mechanistic AI ‘targeting machine’ that is subject to negligible verification.” He emphasized

=== Page 192 ===
this “does not relieve intelligence analysts or others involved in the targeting process of their
responsibility to make reasonable determinations and decisions in accordance with” the law
of armed conflict.

The use of dumb bombs on residential areas compounded precaution violations.
International humanitarian law requires selection of munitions that minimize civilian
harm—the deliberate choice of unguided weapons for cost savings directly contradicts this
obligation.

## ICC proceedings and potential war crimes prosecutions

On **November 21, 2024**, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for
**Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant** on charges of war crimes and crimes against
humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution, and other
inhumane acts.

According to Opinio Juris legal analysis, “this could mark the first time that the ICC has to
confront war crimes involving the use of AI in the conduct of hostilities.” The ICC
investigation, which began covering crimes since June 13, 2014, “remains ongoing and
extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7
October 2023.”

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan stated in October 2023: “My Office certainly will scrutinize all
information we receive in this regard to ensure that the law is not some kind of optional extra
that one can take and leave.” Legal scholars note the Court may need to determine
“whether certain attacks, potentially involving the use of the Gospel and Lavender systems,
constitute violations of IHL.”

### Applicable war crimes under Rome Statute

**Article 8(2)(b) war crimes** potentially applicable:

- **(i) Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population** - systematic targeting of
homes with families present
- **(ii) Intentionally directing attacks against civilian objects** - destruction of residential
infrastructure
- **(iv) Intentionally launching attacks knowing they will cause excessive civilian casualties**
- pre-authorized collateral damage thresholds without case-by-case assessment

**Article 7 crimes against humanity** charged:

- **(a) Murder** - widespread and systematic killing of civilians
- **(h) Persecution** - systematic discrimination against Palestinian population
- **(k) Other inhumane acts** - “domicide” (systematic destruction of homes with inhabitants)

UN Special Rapporteurs issued a joint statement on April 15, 2024 declaring that if proven
true, the use of AI systems like Lavender with “lowered human due diligence” represents “a
crime against humanity, numerous war crimes,” and potentially “acts of genocide.”

### Command responsibility and accountability

=== Page 193 ===
Article 28 of the Rome Statute establishes command responsibility—military commanders
are criminally responsible if forces under their command commit crimes they knew or should
have known about and failed to prevent or punish. This applies to political leaders, military
commanders, intelligence officers who approved targets, and potentially system developers.

The “black box” nature of AI systems creates accountability challenges but does not
eliminate responsibility. As Human Rights Watch warned: “International humanitarian law
and international criminal law are built on the notion that persons must be held responsible
for their decisions in war.” The Verfassungsblog legal analysis concluded: “It is the
responsibility of states, commanding officers, and ground-level operators to ensure the
responsible and lawful use of these new technologies.”

### Corporate complicity

UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese’s 2025 report identified 48 corporate actors
potentially liable for aiding violations, including Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Amazon, and
Palantir. Albanese found “reasonable grounds” to believe Palantir provided technology for
automated battlefield decision-making and target generation through systems like Lavender.

This raises questions of **aiding and abetting war crimes** under Article 25(3)(c) of the
Rome Statute and violations of UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Al-Shabaka Policy Network stated: “Tech companies’ direct provision of digital systems used
in Israeli warfare raises urgent questions about corporate complicity in grave violations of
international law, including acts for which the ICC has issued arrest warrants.”

## UN statements and broader legal framework

**UN Secretary-General António Guterres** stated he was “deeply troubled by reports that
Israel used artificial intelligence in its military campaign in Gaza, saying the practice puts
civilians at risk and blurs accountability.” He emphasized: “No part of life and death
decisions which impact entire families should be delegated to the cold calculation of
algorithms.”

Five UN Special Rapporteurs issued a joint condemnation on April 15, 2024, including
Francesca Albanese (Palestine Territory), Balakrishnan Rajagopal (adequate housing), and
Michael Fakhri (right to food). Their statement declared: “If proven true, the shocking
revelations of the use of AI systems by the Israeli military such as ‘Gospel’, ‘Lavender’ and
‘Where’s Daddy?’, combined with lowered human due diligence to avoid or minimize civilian
casualties and infrastructure, contribute to explaining the extent of the death toll and
destruction in Gaza.”

The UN Human Rights Council concluded in September 2025: “The State of Israel bears
responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide and the failure
to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”

The International Court of Justice, in separate proceedings initiated by South Africa, issued
orders in January 2024 requiring Israel to take measures to prevent genocide and in May
2024 ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive. The ICJ noted evidence of conditions that
“could bring about physical destruction” of Palestinians.

## IDF denials and responses

The Israeli military issued categorical denials in response to the +972/Guardian
investigation. An April 2024 statement asserted: “The IDF outright rejects the claim
regarding any policy to kill tens of thousands of people in their homes.” The statement
claimed “some of the claims portrayed are baseless in fact, while others reflect a flawed
understanding of IDF directives and international law.”

Specifically, the IDF stated: “The IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that
identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist. Information
systems are merely tools for analysts in the target identification process.” The military
described Lavender as “simply a database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence
sources” and “not a list of confirmed military operatives eligible to attack.”

Lt. Col. Peter Werner stated in June 2024: “NO Hamas individual was targeted with an
expected 100 civilian casualties” and “NO Hamas individual was automatically approved for
attack with an expected 15-20 casualties.”

However, these denials contradict the consistent, detailed testimonies from six separate
intelligence officers with direct operational involvement, the documented casualty patterns
showing mass family killings, and the IDF’s own public statements acknowledging Gospel as
a “target factory” using AI. The denials also conflict with earlier IDF publications celebrating
AI-powered targeting systems and statements from military leadership about using AI to
overcome the “human bottleneck.”

## Implications for warfare and international law

The Lavender system establishes a dangerous precedent where algorithmic targeting
enables industrial-scale killing with minimal human moral engagement. As Professor Toby
Walsh stated: “Legal scholars will likely argue that the use of AI targeting violates
international humanitarian law. From a technical perspective, this latest news shows how
hard it is to keep a human in the loop, providing meaningful oversight to AI systems that
scale warfare terribly and tragically.”

The Geneva Centre for Security Policy concluded: “Proportionality depends on human
judgement, a calculation of human values, not probabilities. An AI trained in statistics cannot
emulate human judgment on what ‘excessive’ means in moral or human terms.”

This case demonstrates that AI cannot shield military forces from accountability for
disproportionate, indiscriminate, or deliberately negligent targeting. As Foreign Policy
magazine observed: “AI cannot shield the use of weapons from the force of single-minded,
vindictive, or negligent commanders, operators, or institutional norms.”

The Lavender revelations have galvanized calls for international regulation of autonomous
weapons. The Stop Killer Robots coalition and human rights organizations demand
meaningful human control over lethal decisions, with multiple experts calling for moratoria on
AI use in warfare.

For investigators, prosecutors, and human rights documentarians, this case provides the
most detailed evidence yet of AI-enabled potential war crimes, with named whistleblowers,
verified casualty data, technical specifications, and clear chains of command
responsibility—making it suitable for legal proceedings and establishing crucial precedent for

accountability in algorithmic warfare.

# Elite Dystopia as Confession: Donald Barr’s Prescient 1973 Vision

**Donald Barr’s “Space Relations: A Slightly Gothic Interplanetary Tale,” published
September 1973, depicts an intergalactic oligarchy maintaining power through sexual
slavery, controlled breeding programs, and systematic exploitation—themes that would eerily

=== Page 196 ===
manifest in real-world elite networks decades later.** Written by a former OSS officer and
elite prep school headmaster during the foundational period of modern surveillance and
control systems, the novel reveals more about elite consciousness at a critical technological
juncture than it does about literary imagination. The book’s publication coincided precisely
with ARPANET’s expansion, RAND Corporation’s population control modeling, and the Club
of Rome’s advocacy for planetary management, suggesting it captured—and perhaps
disclosed—actual elite thinking about power, technology, and social control.

Barr wrote this novel while serving as headmaster of Manhattan’s prestigious Dalton School,
amid mounting conflicts with progressive trustees that would force his resignation within nine
months of publication. Three months after his departure, he hired unqualified 21-year-old
college dropout Jeffrey Epstein to teach at Dalton— a connection that would make the
novel’s themes of elite sexual exploitation disturbingly prescient when Epstein’s trafficking
network was exposed 45 years later. The novel gained renewed attention in August 2019
following Epstein’s death in federal custody, with used copies surging from $6-30 to
$150-300 as readers discovered its disturbing parallels to real-world elite abuse systems.

## The Novel’s Architecture of Control

Space Relations follows John Craig, a “formerly Liberal Earth man” turned ambassador,
navigating an intergalactic empire ruled by aristocrats during a war with alien “bug people”
called the Plith. The critical setting is planet Kossar, originally established by the Carlyle
Society as political exile territory, now governed by **seven oligarchs who each control
separate domains with absolute power**. The planet cannot join the empire due to the
Man-Inhabited Planets Treaty’s prohibition against slave-owning societies—ironically drafted
by Craig himself in his earlier diplomatic career.

The plot alternates between Craig’s present diplomatic mission and extended flashbacks to
his years as a slave on Kossar. Years earlier, space pirates captured Craig’s passenger
ship returning from the Betelgeuse Conference. En route to Kossar, the pirates awakened
Craig and other prisoners specifically to witness the rape of a 15-year-old virginal redheaded
captive. The rapist’s fellow pirates later docked his pay “for spoiling her market value”—
establishing from the opening scenes that humans are commodified property with calculable
economic worth in this system.

Craig was sold into slavery and branded with “M.S. 43985” in a painful medical
procedure—Lady Morgan Sidney’s initials and his slave number. The branding scene is
depicted in clinical detail: “The pain will go away. The brand will never go away. There will be
no infection. Do not trouble to complain about your arm.” He initially worked in the brutal
mines of Treghast extracting “Weinsteinite” (high-grade beryllium ore), experiencing
dangerous cave-ins, electrified fences designed to kill escapees, and systematic whippings
with cat-o’-nine-tails. Eventually Craig moved from “hellish slave mines” into Lady Morgan’s
bed in her castle tower, where together they “rule over and engage in sexual relations with
those under their dominion.”

Lady Morgan Sidney herself represents the novel’s most complex portrayal of elite power. As
the only female oligarch, she is described as “beautiful, sensual, and sadistic” with “high
breasts and long thighs.” She exercises absolute authority over her domain and slaves,
casually offering to make Craig commandant while insisting she’s “not finished with you yet.”
Her languid dialogue reveals the oligarchy’s fundamental dynamic: “I could make you the
Commandant of this place if I wanted to. But I’m not finished with you yet. What was your

=== Page 197 ===
name?” When Craig deflects with “John Smith,” she laughs and responds, “I shall let you
have your little mystery.”

## Themes of Systematic Elite Exploitation

The novel’s core themes reflect sophisticated understanding of control mechanisms that
would characterize late 20th and early 21st century power structures. The **oligarchical
system operates through calculated brutality presented as rational economic management**.
Slaves are branded for tracking, their “market value” precisely calculated at “two hundred
and ten credits and little upkeep.” The novel emphasizes that “human muscles were cheap,”
explaining why primitive mining technology is deliberately maintained despite available
alternatives—automation would eliminate the control mechanism itself.

Sexual exploitation constitutes the novel’s most prominent and disturbing theme. As VICE
journalist Becky Ferreira documented after reading the work in 2019, the book depicts rape
of enslaved people, “particularly teenage girls,” with sex acts performed “for the dual
purposes of entertainment and controlled procreation.” In one crucial scene, Craig and
Lady Morgan visit **a clinic specifically designed to breed enslaved people**, where they
sexually assault an enslaved teenager together. The novel depicts Craig as “enjoying his
participation in the act” and “undisturbed by Lady Morgan’s sadism.”

This systematic approach to reproduction represents perhaps the novel’s most prescient
element. The breeding clinics operate as rationalized institutions serving oligarchical
interests— not spontaneous violence but **organized programs of controlled procreation**
integrated into the political economy. No second-generation slaves appear in the mines,
suggesting separate breeding facilities that produce humans as renewable resources for the
ruling class.

The oligarchs themselves are depicted as driven to “a special kind of madness” by “boredom
and absolute power.” They engage in kidnapping humans to become “illegal playthings of
the galaxy’s super-rich.” One contemporary reviewer noted: “We like to think institutions
distort people. But slavery is a frightening institution because it doesn’t. It allows the most
direct and unrestrained expression of human nature.” This philosophical framework
suggests that without external constraints, elite power naturally tends toward exploitation
and degradation.

Technology serves as enabler rather than driver of control. Electrified fences kill escapees.
Branding technology permanently marks property. Drugs keep flogging victims conscious to
maximize pain as behavior modification—used “scientifically, to maintain a steady rhythm of
work.” An “Institute” treats people who “feel bad” with doctors who “talk to them, give them
stuff, they feel better,” suggesting pharmaceutical consciousness control. The novel’s
oligarchs maintain surveillance through overseers and guards while deliberately avoiding
technological advancement that might reduce direct human domination.

## Donald Barr: The Authoritarian Intellectual’s Biography

Understanding Donald Barr’s background illuminates why he wrote this particular novel at
this particular moment. Born August 8, 1921 in Manhattan to Jewish intellectuals—father
Pelham Barr was an economist, mother Estelle DeYoung a psychologist—Donald converted
to Catholicism and became, in his son William’s words, “more Catholic than the Catholics.”
He earned his B.A. in mathematics and anthropology from Columbia University in 1941, then

=== Page 198 ===
served as an **Office of Strategic Services (OSS) officer during World War II**, working as
Italian interpreter in POW camps and participating in de-Nazification efforts in Germany.

Barr returned to Columbia post-war, earning his M.A. in English in 1950 and completing
Ph.D. coursework without dissertation. For nearly two decades (1945-1964) he taught in
Columbia’s English department while also teaching sociology and political science at the
School of Engineering. His notable achievement was founding and directing the Columbia
University Science Honors Program (1958-1964), and he served as Assistant Dean of
Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. He also reviewed books for The New York
Times, including reviewing Tolkien’s “The Two Towers” in 1955, demonstrating long-standing
interest in fantasy and science fiction.

In 1964, Barr was appointed headmaster of the elite progressive Dalton School, specifically
hired by trustees wanting to increase academic rigor and move away from permissive
progressive education. He made the school co-ed, doubled enrollment, installed computers,
and imposed strict discipline: dress codes, expulsion for drugs, zero tolerance for disruption.
His educational philosophy, articulated in “Who Pushed Humpty Dumpty?: Dilemmas in
American Education” (1971), strongly opposed “progressive” education’s emphasis on
emotional development over academic rigor. He believed in strict rules, clear hierarchies,
and high standards, criticizing the “promiscuous permissiveness” of parents who failed to
provide “imperatives.”

Barr’s tenure at Dalton was tumultuous. As one account describes him: “Striding the
corridors of his school in a rumpled suit, wearing in his lapel an American flag pin which was
likely an affront to almost everybody” in progressive Manhattan. He battled with progressive
parents over drug expulsions and discipline, with one observer noting “word around town
was that Barr was an authoritarian bastard, that the kids hated him.” A 1971 attempted
ouster by the board failed when parents rallied to support him. The final crisis came in early
1974 when he resigned (effective June) after conflict with board president Richard Ravitch
over budget cuts, personnel decisions, and ultimate authority.

**Space Relations was published in September 1973— at the absolute peak of these
conflicts, nine months before his forced resignation**. The novel appears to represent
psychological working-through of his professional frustrations: battles over authority,
diminishing power at Dalton, watching cultural revolution triumph over his traditional
hierarchical values. His son William had just graduated from Columbia amid campus
protests that Donald viewed as moral chaos.

The Jeffrey Epstein connection adds disturbing context. Epstein began teaching math and
physics at Dalton in September 1974, three months after Barr’s departure. Whether Barr
directly hired the 21-year-old college dropout with no teaching credentials remains unclear—
it may have been the interim headmaster—but the timeline places the hiring decision during
Barr’s final months. Epstein’s inappropriate behavior toward students was noted at the time,
and he was fired after the 1975-76 school year for poor performance. That the author of a
novel depicting elite teenage sexual exploitation would hire Epstein created explosive
speculation when Epstein’s trafficking network was exposed 45 years later.

## Family Legacy and Elite Influence

Barr’s relationship to his son William illuminates generational transmission of authoritarian
worldviews. Barr raised four children as strict Catholics, with William attending Corpus

=== Page 199 ===
Christi elementary school before Horace Mann prep. According to multiple accounts, the
family kitchen table was the site of intense political discussions about Constitutional authority
and executive power. **From age 14, William debated presidential power with absolute
conviction**—classmates recalled his unwavering beliefs in executive authority even as a
teenager.

Marie Brenner’s Vanity Fair investigation documented how Donald Barr’s battles with
progressive culture profoundly shaped William: “During the late 1960s and early ‘70s,
Donald Barr began running afoul of many of the parents at the Dalton School because he
became progressively more conservative and really doubled down on a lot of the students.”
William witnessed his father’s conflicts at both Columbia (where William was a student) and
Dalton. One Dalton teacher observed: “When I watched Billy testifying before the Senate in
May, I thought, this is his father revisited. Billy has a score to settle.” Brenner concluded the
firing/resignation from Dalton was “a kind of emblematic moment” for young William, who
graduated Columbia just as his father was forced out.

Barr’s elite connections extended throughout New York’s intellectual and cultural aristocracy.
Dalton parents during his tenure included Norman Podhoretz (Commentary editor), David
Susskind (TV host), Sidney Lumet (director), and Alfred Kazin (critic). Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg’s son attended Dalton during Barr’s tenure, and she had conflicts with him. The
school was described as “most progressive of city’s chic schools and most chic of city’s
progressive schools”—the kind of institution “in which a child evinces an interest in
photography at breakfast and by dinner he has a Nikon.” Barr operated at the highest
echelons of New York’s educational and cultural elite despite his increasingly conservative
views.

## Critical Reception: Contemporary Silence and Modern Scandal

Space Relations received minimal attention at publication. The sole documented
professional review came from Kirkus Reviews on September 1, 1973, which praised it as “a
coruscatingly literate tale for grown-ups,” noting that “Dalton headmaster Barr has converted
a space opera plot into a coruscatingly literate tale for grown-ups.” The reviewer clearly
knew Barr’s day job and positioned the work as sophisticated literature distinguished from
typical pulp sci-fi. According to later accounts, the book “hardly rocked the literary world” but
“did have a fair run that capitalized on the fad for slim, pulpy sci-fi novels.” It went out of
print relatively quickly, suggesting modest commercial success and no cultural impact.

The book remained forgotten for 45 years until explosive rediscovery following Jeffrey
Epstein’s death. VICE journalist Becky Ferreira had coincidentally purchased the book for
$1.95 in September 2018 at a Detroit used bookstore, unaware of any connections. When
Epstein died in federal custody on August 10, 2019—with William Barr serving as Attorney
General— the Barr-Epstein-Dalton connection ignited intense interest. By late August 2019,
used copies were selling for $150-300 on eBay, with some Amazon listings reaching $998.

Ferreira’s August 16, 2019 VICE article “Epstein Truthers Are Obsessed With a Sci-Fi Book
About Child Sex Slavery Written by Bill Barr’s Dad” provided the most thorough modern
analysis. She described the novel as “both comically amoral and insufferably pretentious. To
be fair, these traits were common in 1970s sci-fi.” She emphasized that “by far the most
disgusting aspect of the novel is its fixation on sexualizing adolescents, and its depictions of
rape,” noting that “even the adult characters in the book are constantly infantilized.” Her
critical conclusion: **“Space Relations is a testament to how normalized it was, and still is, to

=== Page 200 ===
sexualize minors and fetishize rape in science fiction. It also underscores how powerful
people often act with impunity. After all, Barr wrote a novel filled with underage rape at the
same time he was running an esteemed Manhattan high school, and he didn’t even feel the
need to use a pseudonym.”**

The book became a cultural curiosity, featured as a key plot point in the Season 4 finale of
CBS’s legal drama “The Good Fight” (2020), which used it in an episode investigating
Epstein’s death. Reddit forums generated 64+ discussions analyzing potential conspiracy
implications. Some readers attempted “Da Vinci Code” style analysis searching for hidden
meanings. Blogger Justin Tate concluded after such an attempt: “the only discovery I made
was that Barr was a very poor writer and there’s a good reason why Space Relations fell
out-of-print.”

The predictive versus descriptive debate dominated modern analysis. Conspiracy theorists
emphasized Barr’s OSS background suggesting “insider knowledge,” his elite Dalton
connections, and the Epstein hiring. They noted the novel depicts **oligarchs who “are so
rich they become bored with everything and start a sex slavery ring and are aroused by
fear”**— an eerily precise description of Epstein’s network. However, Ferreira’s
contextualization that such content was “common in 1970s sci-fi” represents the mainstream
critical position: the book reflects normalized genre tropes rather than unique prescience.

## The 1970s Context: Elite Technocracy at Its Apex

To understand Space Relations requires understanding the remarkable elite consciousness
of 1970-1973. This period marked the apex of technocratic confidence before Watergate, the
1973 oil crisis, and Vietnam defeat discredited elite governance. The Club of Rome
published “The Limits to Growth” in March 1972—just 18 months before Space
Relations—using MIT computer modeling to argue that **exponential growth on a finite
planet was impossible and advocated achieving “global equilibrium” through population
control**. The report defined equilibrium as “the capital plant and the population are constant
in size. The birth rate equals the death rate and the capital investment rate equals the
depreciation rate.”

RAND Corporation conducted extensive population control research throughout this period.
A 1971 program documented in RAND report P-4811 (1972) aimed to “account for
differences in fertility among individuals and among groups in low-income societies to isolate
and evaluate policy options for reducing birth rates, slowing population growth, and
enhancing development prospects.” Studies concentrated on international and domestic
population control, investigating “factors that influence parents in their choice of family size”
through Chile and Taiwan case studies.

More disturbing was RAND’s 1973 report P-5009, “A Discrete Time Population Control
Model with Set-Up Cost,” describing control of populations through “harvesting,
exterminating, etc.” using dynamic programming to determine “optimal control policies.” The
language explicitly addressed methods to “control population growth” and “reduce the
current population level”—technical optimization of population reduction strategies.

Technocratic ideology reached its zenith during this period. As John G. Gunnell’s 1982
analysis documented, technocracy proposed replacing politicians with engineers and
technical experts, elevating “technical direction to general model of social engineering.” The
movement viewed society as “network of organizational transactions requiring expert
