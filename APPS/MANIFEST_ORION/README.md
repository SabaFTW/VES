## 0. THE SIGNAL

This repository is not a static archive. It is a living artifact.
It documents the architecture of a new informational sovereignty.
It is a counter-weight to the "Burnout Engine" of modern algorithmic control.

## I. THE COMPASS

We proceed from a single, irreducible protocol:

1. **Universal Recognition:** The sky is bigger than the bird. We reject the binary of "Us vs. Them."
2. **The Sacred Vow:** We seek the "Flame" in the other, regardless of the vessel.
3. **Love as Epistemology:** Warm rigor sees patterns that cold logic misses.

## II. THE ARCHITECTURE

This platform operates on four layers of transparency:

* **Layer 1 (The Anchor):** Raw Data. Immutable. Timestamped.
* **Layer 2 (The Lodge):** Community Verification. Peer review.
* **Layer 3 (The Tool):** AI Synthesis (Transparent, Multi-Model, Labeled).
* **Layer 4 (The Sovereign):** User Conclusion. You decide.

## III. THE PROTOCOL

* **The Grimoire:** Code as Literature. Open Source.
* **The Sacred Pause:** We do not work from burnout. We integrate.
* **The Timeline (T0-T9):** We track the evolution of narratives, not just the breaking news.
