# Code of Conduct

Manifest Orion is a collaborative project built on transparency, respect, and intellectual honesty.  
All contributors are expected to follow these guidelines.

---

## 1. Respectful Communication

- Treat all participants with dignity.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- Avoid sarcasm, hostility, or inflammatory language.

## 2. The Sacred Vow (Project Ethos)

This project includes a philosophical commitment called **The Sacred Vow**, which applies to all interactions:

1. **No Dehumanization**  
   Do not reduce any participant to an object, stereotype, or target.

2. **No Hierarchy of Being**  
   All contributors are treated as equals in discussion and review.

3. **Warm Rigor**  
   Combine clarity with empathy.  
   Precision does not require coldness.

These principles guide tone, not metaphysics.
