### 1. Timelines (T0-T9)

We track narratives as they drift. If you have data on a specific story:

- Provide archive links (Wayback Machine) for all sources.

### 2. Myths & Lore

If you have a story, metaphor, or "Sausage" that helps humans remember their sovereignty:

- Submit a Markdown file to `lore/`.
- Ensure it aligns with the "Compass."

### 3. Core Philosophy

The `core/` documents are the constitution of this project. Changes here are subject to intense peer review and must uphold the "Sacred Vow."

## Submission Process

- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch.
- Submit a Pull Request.
