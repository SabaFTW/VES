# 🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE: The Four Layers of Transparency

**Status:** SYSTEM DESIGN DOCUMENT  
**Purpose:** Define the technical structure that prevents Manifest Orion from becoming a "Black Box" system.

Manifest Orion is built on a simple principle:

> **Truth emerges when every layer of interpretation is visible.**

To achieve this, the platform uses a **Four‑Layer Transparency Stack**.  
Each layer is independent, auditable, and explicitly labeled.

---

# I. LAYER 1 — RAW DATA (THE ANCHOR)

**Role:** Provide immutable, unfiltered source material.

This layer contains:

- Original documents  
- Archived URLs  
- Screenshots  
- PDFs  
- Primary sources  

**Rules:**

- No summaries  
- No interpretation  
- No editing  
- No deletion (only versioning)  

**Why it matters:**  
Every narrative begins with a T0.  
Without an anchor, drift cannot be measured.

---

# II. LAYER 2 — COMMUNITY VERIFICATION (THE LODGE)

**Role:** Provide context, annotation, and peer review.

This layer includes:

- Notes  
- Citations  
- Counter‑evidence  
- Timeline corrections  
- “Community Notes”‑style clarifications  

**Rules:**

- All annotations must reference Layer 1  
- No personal attacks  
- No dehumanization (per the Sacred Vow)  
- All edits are public and versioned  

**Why it matters:**  
Truth is not a monologue.  
It is a conversation with receipts.

---

# III. LAYER 3 — AI SYNTHESIS (THE TOOL)

**Role:** Provide optional summaries, comparisons, and pattern detection.

This layer includes:

- AI‑generated summaries  
- Multi‑model comparisons  
- Drift analysis  
- Suggested timelines  

**Rules:**

- Must be explicitly labeled as AI output  
- Must cite Layer 1 and Layer 2  
- Must never override human judgment  
- Must never be treated as authoritative  

**Why it matters:**  
AI is a tool, not a verdict.  
It accelerates understanding but does not define it.

---

# IV. LAYER 4 — USER SOVEREIGNTY (THE VERDICT)

**Role:** The final decision‑making layer.

This layer belongs entirely to the user.

The user sees:

- The raw data  
- The community annotations  
- The AI synthesis  

And then decides:

- What is true  
- What is uncertain  
- What requires more evidence  

**Rules:**

- No forced conclusions  
- No hidden ranking algorithms  
- No engagement optimization  
- No black‑box filtering  

**Why it matters:**  
Sovereignty is the opposite of manipulation.  
The user is the final authority.

# SUMMARY DIAGRAM

```
Layer 4 — User Sovereignty (Decision)
Layer 3 — AI Synthesis (Optional)
Layer 2 — Community Verification (Context)
Layer 1 — Raw Data (Anchor)
```

Each layer is visible.  
Each layer is auditable.  
Each layer is optional — except Layer 1.

# THE PROMISE OF THE STACK

This architecture ensures that Manifest Orion is:

- **Transparent** (no hidden logic)  
- **Accountable** (every edit is traceable)  
- **Decentralized** (no single authority)  
- **Human‑centered** (user decides)  
- **Resilient** (drift is measurable)  

This is not a black box.  
This is a **glass engine**.
