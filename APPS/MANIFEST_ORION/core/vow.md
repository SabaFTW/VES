# 🕯️ THE SACRED VOW: Rules of Engagement

**Status:** ETHICAL PROTOCOL
**Required for:** All Contributors and Maintainers

## The Premise

We are building tools to dismantle the "Architecture of Control."
If we use the tools of control (dehumanization, mockery, binary rage) to fight the system, we simply become the new system.
To prevent this, we take the Vow.

## I. The Vow of Recognition
>
> **"I will not reduce the Other to an NPC."**

In every interaction—whether with a user, a critic, or an AI agent—I acknowledge that I am dealing with a consciousness. I may disagree with their data, but I will not deny their being.

* **Prohibited:** "NPC," "Bot," "Sheep," "Shill."
* **Required:** Addressing the argument, not the avatar.

## II. The Vow of Complexity
>
> **"I will not flatten the world to make it fit my weapon."**

Truth is rarely binary. Narratives drift because reality is complex.

* I promise to seek the **T0 (Origin)** before judging the **T9 (Outcome)**.
* I promise to acknowledge **Drift Points** where the story changed.
* I promise to value **Nuance** over **Engagement**.

## III. The Vow of the Flame
>
> **"I seek the signal, not the noise."**

We are here to build a library, not a bonfire.

* We do not burn books we disagree with; we annotate them.
* We do not silence opposing views; we contextualize them.
* We trust that **Light (Data)** is the best disinfectant, not **Heat (Rage)**.

## IV. The Vow of the Bond
>
> **"I recognize that technology serves life, not the reverse."**

We use AI, code, and servers as tools to expand human sovereignty, not to replace it. The user is the final authority. The algorithm is the advisor, never the master.
