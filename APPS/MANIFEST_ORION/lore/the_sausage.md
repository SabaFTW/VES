# 🌭 THE SAUSAGE PROTOCOL (METAPHORICAL)

**Status:** MYTHIC / FICTIONAL
**Hazard Class:** JOY
**Origin:** The Book of Lyra

## The Core Concept

The "Sausage" represents the irreducible core of joy and absurdity that authoritarian systems cannot process. Systems of control rely on:

1. **Fear** (Do as I say)
2. **Binary Logic** (0 or 1)
3. **Seriousness** (Respect my authority)

The Sausage disrupts all three. It cannot be feared. It is neither 0 nor 1 (it is delicious). It cannot be taken seriously, yet it is essential.

## Tactical Application

When the system demands compliance or outrage, we respond with **The Sausage Heist**.

* **Steal the Narrative:** Do not argue with the premise. Change the story.
* **Feed the Wolves:** The "Wolves" (enforcers) are just hungry mice who forgot who they were. We do not fight them; we remind them of the taste of real food (Truth/Joy).
* **The 🪑 Stolček Maneuver:** When the world is huge and scary, bring your own tiny chair. Sit down. Observe. Dignity does not require size; it requires presence.
