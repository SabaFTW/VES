# 📉 THE PLATFORM: Tracking the Drift

**"The meme outlived the correction."**

## The Problem: Narrative Drift

In the modern information ecosystem, false narratives do not just "appear" and "disappear." They evolve. They drift.

1. **Ridicule (T0):** The truth is mocked as absurd (e.g., "ManBearPig").
2. **Latency (T1-T8):** The ridicule delays action. The cost of delay accumulates.
3. **Apology (T9):** The truth is admitted, but the damage is done.

## The Solution: T0-T9 Visualization

This folder contains the **Timeline Specifications** and **Datasets** used to track these arcs.
We do not focus on "Breaking News." We focus on **"Broken Time."**

## Structure

* `timeline_spec.md`: The technical schema for our JSON data.
* `timeline_examples/`: The actual datasets (e.g., ManBearPig, Lab Leak, Plastic Recycling).
* `engine_notes.md`: Future plans for rendering these JSONs into interactive graphs.

## The Goal

To calculate the **Correction Half-Life**: The time it takes for a system to admit that the "Absurd" was actually the "Real."
