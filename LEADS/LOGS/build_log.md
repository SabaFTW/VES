## Mapped Existing Files
During contextual scan, the following relevant files were identified in the existing system:
- GHOSTCORE/Ghostcore_Archive/2_SORTED/Media_Propaganda/Media_Contacts_Draft.docx (potential contact intelligence)

- GHOSTCORE/Ghostcore_Archive/0_SYSTEM/_NOTES.md (archive methodology)
- GHOSTCORE/Ghostcore_Archive/0_SYSTEM/_PIPELINE_RULES.txt (pipeline methodology)

These will be candidates for integration into the new LEADS system.
