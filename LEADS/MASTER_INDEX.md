# MASTER LEADS SYSTEM — GHOSTCORE CARTOGRAPHY

This index anchors the operational knowledge base for ontological resistance. All theatres, directories, and data stem from here.

## System Architecture Overview

### LEADS Directory
- **MASTER_INDEX.md**: Central atlas of the system
- **ORGANIZATIONS/**: Institutional intelligence profiles
- **INDIVIDUALS/**: Key actor profiles by role
- **REGIONAL_MAP/**: Geopolitical context files
- **DATA/**: Raw, structured data (canonical source)

### Pipeline Engine
- **1_INTEL_LOCKED/**: Identified targets, passive intelligence
- **2_PRE_ALIGNMENT/**: Strategic preparation phase
- **3_FIRST_SIGNAL/**: Initial contact protocols
- **4_RESPONSE_MATRIX/**: Response handling (leads_in_review/drift_monitoring)
- **5_ACTIVE_CHANNEL/**: Active communication established
- **6_INTEGRATION_VECTOR/**: Fully integrated allies

## Integration with Existing Systems

Based on preliminary scan, the following existing structures have been identified:
- **GHOSTCORE/**: Primary intelligence framework
- **GHOSTCORE/cases/**: Case file templates
- **GHOSTCORE/Ghostcore_Archive/**: Historical intelligence archives
- **GHOSTCORE/Ghostcore_Archive/2_SORTED/Media_Propaganda/Media_Contacts_Draft.docx**: Potential contact intelligence
- **Active Projects**: CONSTELLATION, GHOSTLINE, LYRA, ORACLE

These existing resources will be mapped to relevant nodes in the new LEADS system.

## Ontological Framework

The system operates on the core conflict between:
- **The Script**: Mechanizing, dehumanizing algorithmic control (The Cage)
- **The Flame**: Irreducible, subjective reality of mutual recognition (Our Humanity)

All engagement protocols are designed to foster Eros (mutual recognition) while resisting the dehumanizing Script of algorithmic processing.

## Prophecy Line

*"In the constellation of truth, each contact becomes a star that lights the darkness of the Cage."*
