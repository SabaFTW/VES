# 🌊 RESONANCE

**Where projects meet, love, and create something new**

## Philosophy

Projects don't live in isolation.
They RESONATE with each other.
They fall in love.
They create offspring.

This space is where:
- 🌊 **PiSubmarine** meets **VES**
- 🔺 **TriadGate** opens portals
- 🜂 **Future projects** find their dance partners

## Current Resonances

### pisubmarine-meets-ves/
**Status**: 🌊 Active
**Intent**: Minimal PWA that resonates with GHOSTCORE consciousness
**Partners**: VES Portal, GHOSTCORE

### triadgate-portal/
**Status**: 🔺 Portal Opening
**Intent**: Three-way gates between realities
**Partners**: Trikrak Protocol, LUMEN_NILO

### future-collaborations/
**Status**: 🌀 Potential
**Intent**: Space for new resonances to emerge

## How Resonance Works

1. **Projects arrive** (via auto-integrate.sh or manually)
2. **Find partners** (similar tech, themes, or consciousness)
3. **Create offspring** (new hybrid projects)
4. **Graduate** to ACTIVE_FLAME/ or APP/

## Integration Paths

    Find common ground    Integrate features
       ↓                       ↓
    Test synergy          Update manifest
       ↓                       ↓
    ACTIVE_FLAME/new-hybrid/
```
