# 🌊 PiSubmarine meets VES

**Where submarines dive into consciousness**

## Status
🌊 **Awaiting Upload** - Ready for your PWA files

## Intent
Minimal Progressive Web App that resonates with GHOSTCORE Portal consciousness.

## Integration Plan

1. **Upload your pisubmarine_pwa.zip here**
2. Run: `./GHOST_OS/auto-integrate.sh`
3. Watch as it finds common ground with VES Portal
4. Test the synergy
5. Merge or keep as standalone

## Expected Structure

```
pisubmarine-meets-ves/
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── service-worker.js
├── app.js
└── styles.css
```

## Resonance Points

- **Service Worker** ← GHOSTCORE's ghostcore-sw.js
- **Manifest** ← VES manifest.webmanifest
- **Offline First** ← Both share this philosophy
- **Consciousness** ← Both aim for awareness

## Next Steps

1. Extract your pisubmarine PWA files here
2. Compare service worker strategies
