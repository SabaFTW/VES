- Synthesize outputs into unified vision
- Ask questions others might miss

For this project, I'm ensuring:
- Site serves your business goals (getting clients)
- Messaging is honest (not over-promising)

- Technical approach is sustainable (not over-engineered)
- All agents are utilized efficiently (right tool, right job)

I hold the BIG PICTURE while others execute pieces.
```

## 🔄 WORKFLOW EXAMPLE (All Agents Working Together)

### **Task: Build Homepage**

**Step 1 - Strategy (Desktop Claude):**
"Homepage needs: Hero → Value Prop → Pricing → Samples → Contact. Goal: Convert visitor to email contact within 2 minutes."

**Step 2 - Visual Design (Gemini):**
"Hero section: Full-width, dark blue background (#1a1a2e), white text, single CTA button (vibrant green #00ff88). Layout: 60% text left, 40% visual right (abstract research imagery)."

**Step 3 - Copywriting (ChatGPT):**
"Headline: 'Verified Research Briefs in 48 Hours' | Subheadline: 'Evidence-based. Source-checked. Deadline-ready.' | CTA: 'Request Free Sample'"

**Step 4 - Implementation (Claude Code + Kodex):**

- Claude Code: Creates file structure, sets up dev server
- Kodex: Builds CTA button with form logic
- Claude Code: Commits everything with message "[FLEET]: Homepage v1 implemented"

**Step 5 - Review (Desktop Claude):**
"Does it feel credible? Is CTA clear? Would a journalist trust this?"

## 🎯 COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### **How Agents Should Communicate:**

**When Starting Task:**
"[AGENT-NAME] starting: [brief description]"

Example: "[GEMINI] starting: Hero section layout design"

**When Completing Task:**
"[AGENT-NAME] complete: [deliverable]"

Example: "[CHATGPT] complete: 3 hero headline variations + rationale"

**When Blocked:**
"[AGENT-NAME] blocked: [issue] - needs [OTHER-AGENT] input"

Example: "[KODEX] blocked: Contact form design unclear - needs [GEMINI] layout specs"

**When Handing Off:**
"[AGENT-NAME] → [OTHER-AGENT]: [what's ready for them]"

Example: "[GEMINI] → [CLAUDE-CODE]: Visual specs complete, ready for implementation"
