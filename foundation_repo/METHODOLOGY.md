# Methodology

## Purpose

This document outlines the structured approach used for researching, documenting and analyzing information within this repository. It serves as a reference for contributors who wish to maintain a consistent and transparent process.

## Guiding Principles

- **Evidence-based**: Use primary or authoritative sources whenever possible and cross-verify facts with multiple independent references.
- **Transparency**: Clearly document assumptions, data sources and analytical methods.
- **Distinction between fact and speculation**: Label conjecture or hypothesis clearly and avoid presenting unverified ideas as established fact.
- **Reproducibility**: Provide sufficient detail for others to reproduce your research and verify your conclusions.
- **Critical thinking**: Question your own biases; actively seek disconfirming evidence to avoid confirmation bias.
- **Ethical considerations**: Respect privacy and legal boundaries, avoid sensationalism, and do not amplify unverified claims.
- **Uncertainty**: Acknowledge gaps in knowledge and limitations of available data.

## Information Handling

1. **Source collection**: Gather data from reputable sources such as academic journals, official reports and credible news outlets. Archive each source for reference.
2. **Verification**: Cross-check key facts with at least two independent sources. Note any discrepancies and investigate further.
3. **Annotation**: Use inline citations or footnotes to point to source materials. Ensure that citations are accessible and well-documented.
4. **Analysis**: Describe observations using neutral language. Separate descriptive statements from evaluative comments and clearly indicate any analytical steps taken.
5. **Speculation**: Clearly mark speculative thoughts with labels like "Hypothesis," "Unverified," or "Requires further research."
6. **Revision**: When new information emerges, update analyses accordingly and record the date of changes.

## Limitations

- This methodology does not guarantee absolute truth; it provides a framework to reduce errors and increase transparency.
- External sources may contain inaccuracies; critical evaluation and skepticism are necessary.
- Time and resource constraints may limit thoroughness; document these limitations to provide context.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Contributors should follow this methodology to maintain consistency across the repository.
- Proposed changes or new analyses should undergo peer review within the community where possible.
- If you identify potential ethical issues or conflicts of interest related to the material, disclose them and address them openly.
