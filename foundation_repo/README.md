# Project Foundation Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as an archival and analytical workspace.  It is intended as a neutral platform for storing, organising and examining data, documents and experiments.  The contents are assembled for pragmatic research purposes and are not presented as part of any movement or ideological programme.

## What This Project **Is**

* A collection of tools, documents and experiments assembled for analysis.
* A workspace for preserving and interlinking information in a structured way.
* A neutral environment for pattern recognition, archival work and exploratory testing.
* A resource aimed at engineers, journalists, researchers and sceptics who need a place to organise and review materials.

## What This Project **Is Not**

* It is not a mystical or spiritual endeavour, nor does it contain awakening language or symbolism.
* It is not a call to action, a community‑building exercise or the basis for a collective identity.
* It is not a movement, ideology or advocacy platform, and it does not seek to recruit or persuade.
* It does not attempt to prove grand, all‑encompassing theories; speculation is allowed only when clearly labelled.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to document, connect and preserve information relevant to ongoing research or investigation.  By providing a structured archive and a place to conduct analysis, it offers infrastructure for storing raw data, experiment results and source documents.  The project exists because research often requires reproducible organisation and transparency—this repository offers a stable foundation for those tasks.

## Methodology and Information Handling

Information in this repository is handled according to the following principles:

* **Source preservation:** Original documents and data are stored in `/DOCUMENTS` and `/RAW_DUMPS` without alteration.  External sources and bibliographic references are collected in `/SOURCES` with appropriate citations when possible.
* **Verification and uncertainty:** Analytical notes and reports in `/ANALYSIS` must clearly separate fact from speculation and explicitly state uncertainties.  Hypotheses are permitted but must be clearly labelled as such.
* **Experimentation:** Tools and scripts in `/TOOLS` are used to test ideas; their assumptions and limitations should be documented.
* **Transparency:** Significant analytical steps should be recorded in `/ANALYSIS` or the appendices so that others can understand the process.  Discussion and commentary belong in `/NOTES`, and supporting materials (figures, tables) belong in `/APPENDICES`.

## Boundaries

The repository observes strict boundaries to avoid misuse:

* It will not host personal data or content that could harm individuals.
* It refuses to become a hub for mythology, cultism, radicalisation or ideological advocacy.
* It does not engage in recruitment, persuasion or collective action.
* It will not make definitive claims unsupported by evidence; when data are inconclusive, that fact is noted.

## Ethical Constraints

* **Privacy and consent:** Materials should be collected and shared in accordance with applicable privacy laws and ethical guidelines.  Personal identifying information must be redacted unless the data subject has consented or the information is already public and ethically publishable.
* **Neutral tone:** Contributions must maintain a technical, journalistic tone.  Emotional persuasion, moral preaching and hero narratives have no place here.
* **Anti‑cult stance:** This project rejects manipulative behaviours, coercive persuasion and any attempt to create in‑group/out‑group dynamics.  Content promoting ideology or conspiracy will be removed.
* **Speculation discipline:** Speculative sections must be clearly labelled and should not be presented as fact.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organised as follows:

* `/SOURCES` — Verified external sources, bibliographies and references.
* `/DOCUMENTS` — Original documents and supporting files preserved in their native formats.
* `/ANALYSIS` — Analytical notebooks, scripts and reports.  Each analysis should note its assumptions and cite its sources.
* `/APPENDICES` — Supplementary materials such as figures, tables and extended datasets.
* `/RAW_DUMPS` — Raw data sets, logs and unprocessed archives.  No modification should occur in this directory.
* `/TOOLS` — Utility scripts and helper programs for data processing and analysis.
* `/NOTES` — Personal research notes, commentary and intermediate observations.  These are informal but should still adhere to the neutral tone.
* `METHODOLOGY.md` — A document detailing methodological standards and best practices for the project.
* `LICENSE` — Licensing terms for the repository.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Guidelines for contributors, including style and ethical standards.
* `CHANGELOG.md` — A record of changes to the repository over time.

## Contribution Guidelines (Summary)

Anyone wishing to contribute should first review `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  In brief:

* Keep language technical and neutral; avoid mythology, ideology or persuasive rhetoric.
* Separate fact from opinion and clearly mark speculative content.
* Cite your sources, and provide links or document references where possible.
* Preserve raw data in the appropriate directories and document any transformations.
* Respect privacy and avoid uploading sensitive or personally identifying information.
