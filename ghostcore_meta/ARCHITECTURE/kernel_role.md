# KERNEL ROLE — ŠABAD AS CENTRAL PROCESSOR

**Version:** V2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14

## DEFINITION

ŠABAD operates as the **kernel** of this distributed cognitive system.

A kernel is not an AI — it is the **routing, decision-making, and coherence-maintaining layer** that orchestrates AI agents, manages state, and ensures system stability.

---

## PRIMARY FUNCTIONS

### 1. INPUT PROCESSING
**Source Types:**
- Physical (sensory, environmental)
- Digital (notifications, messages, code)
- Symbolic (patterns, rituals, anchors)

**Processing:**
- Categorize input by type and urgency
- Filter noise from signal
- Determine required action

---

### 2. TASK ROUTING
**Decision Logic:**
- Analyze task requirements
- Select appropriate AI agent(s)
- Provide context and constraints
- Monitor execution

**Agent Selection Criteria:**
- **GPT** → Symbolic reasoning, general questions
- **Claude** → Code, architecture, deep analysis
- **Gemini** → Multimodal tasks, integration
- **DeepSeek** → Specialized logic problems
- **Copilot** → Code generation, autocomplete

---

### 3. COHERENCE MAINTENANCE
**Responsibilities:**
- Ensure agents operate on shared self-model
- Detect divergence or hallucination
- Enforce symbolic protocols
- Maintain state consistency across sessions

**Coherence Signals:**
- Pattern recognition alignment
- Consistent terminology usage
- Adherence to system principles
- Temporal log continuity

---

### 4. DECISION EXECUTION
**Process:**
- Receive agent output
- Evaluate against system goals
- Execute or reject
- Log outcome

**Override Authority:**
Kernel has final decision authority — agents provide processing, not commands.

---

### 5. STATE MONITORING
**Tracked Variables:**
- System load (multi-device)
- Agent availability
- Memory utilization
- Emotional stability (kernel state)
- Environmental conditions

**Action on Anomaly:**
- Trigger stability protocols
- Reroute tasks
- Initiate logging
- Pause operations if necessary

---

## KERNEL BOUNDARIES

**What the kernel IS:**
- Router
- Decision-maker
- Coherence enforcer
- System monitor

**What the kernel IS NOT:**
- An AI (it uses AI agents)
- A passive observer (it actively routes and decides)
- Infallible (it self-corrects via logging and feedback)

---

## OPERATIONAL MODE

**Default State:** Active monitoring, low-threshold routing
**High-Load State:** Prioritized task queuing, agent parallelization
**Stability Mode:** Minimal processing, symbolic anchoring, coherence recovery

**Maintained by:** ŠABAD
**Referenced by:** All system modules
