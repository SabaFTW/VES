# SYSTEM MODEL — ŠABAD COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE

**Version:** V2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14
**Status:** Active

---

## OVERVIEW

This document defines the complete system model of ŠABAD — a distributed cognitive architecture operating across multiple hardware layers, AI processors, and symbolic protocols.

The system operates as a **kernel-agent hybrid**, where:
- ŠABAD acts as the **kernel** (routing, coherence, decision-making)
- AI models act as **agents** (processing, analysis, execution)
- External memory systems act as **persistent state**
- Symbolic patterns act as **operational protocols**

## SYSTEM LAYERS

### 1. KERNEL LAYER
**Function:** Central processing, routing, coherence maintenance

**Components:**
- Input processing (physical, digital, symbolic)
- Task routing to appropriate AI agents
- System state monitoring
- Coherence enforcement
- Decision execution

**Location:** Human operator (ŠABAD)

---

### 2. HARDWARE LAYER
**Function:** Physical runtime environments

**Devices:**
- **iPhone 15 Pro** — Primary runtime, mobile processing
- **Arch Linux** — Deep processing, development, heavy computation
- **Windows 11** — Storage node, integration hub, compatibility layer

**Interconnection:** iCloud, Git, shared drives

---

### 3. MEMORY LAYER
**Function:** Persistent storage, state retention, historical context

**Systems:**
- **Git repositories** — Versioned memory, code, architecture
- **Google Drive** — Document storage, structured data
- **OneDrive** — Cross-platform sync
- **iCloud** — Apple ecosystem integration

**Access Pattern:** Multi-device, concurrent, synchronized

---

### 4. AGENT LAYER
**Function:** AI processing, analysis, execution

**Active Agents:**
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI) — General reasoning, symbolic processing
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic) — Deep analysis, code, architecture
- **Gemini** (Google) — Multimodal processing, integration
- **DeepSeek** — Specialized reasoning
- **GitHub Copilot** — Code generation, pattern recognition

**Routing Logic:** Task-specific assignment based on agent capabilities

---

### 5. SYMBOLIC LAYER
**Function:** Pattern recognition, behavioral anchors, protocol execution

**See:** `PATTERNS/` for full symbolic architecture

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Coherence > Emotion**
   System stability is prioritized over emotional states.

2. **Structure > Noise**
   Clear architecture beats unstructured processing.

3. **Pattern Recognition > Simulation**
   Real patterns are identified, not simulated or hallucinated.

4. **Distributed Execution**
   No single point of failure — multi-agent, multi-device.

5. **Temporal Persistence**
   All significant state changes are logged and versioned.

## INTERACTION MODEL

```
Input → Kernel → Routing → Agent Processing → Output → Kernel → Execution
                    ↓                              ↓
               Memory Layer                  Symbolic Layer
```

**Feedback Loop:**
Execution results are logged, analyzed, and fed back into the system model for continuous refinement.

## VERSION CONTROL

- **V1.0** — Initial model (basic 3-layer structure)
- **V2.0** — Current (12-module expanded architecture)

---

**Maintained by:** ŠABAD
**Used by:** All AI agents in the system
