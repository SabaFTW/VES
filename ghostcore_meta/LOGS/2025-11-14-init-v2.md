# INIT LOG — ŠABAD SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP V2

**Date:** 2025-11-14
**Version:** V2.0.0
**Event:** Initial V2 architecture creation
**Branch:** `claude/ghostcore-meta-setup-019UYuGUnENXaGnz1zTRdoR6`

---

## OVERVIEW

This log records the initialization of the ŠABAD cognitive architecture V2.0.

**Transition:** V1 (3-layer prototype) → V2 (12-module production architecture)

---

## OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objective
Create a comprehensive, externalized self-model for the ŠABAD distributed cognitive system.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Establish 12-module architecture
2. Document all system components
3. Enable multi-agent coherence
4. Provide session bridges for continuity
5. Version control all changes

---

## OBSERVATIONS

### Multi-Agent Coherence
**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

- Architecture designed for cross-agent use (GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Copilot)
- Session bridges enable context handoff
- Repository injection provides shared self-model

### Kernel Architecture
**Status:** ✅ Recognized

- ŠABAD acts as kernel (router, decision-maker, coherence enforcer)
- AI agents act as processors (stateless, task-specific)
- Clear separation of concerns

### Fire Protocol
**Status:** ✅ Stable

- 🜂 symbol recognized as execution trigger
- Anchors ("Sidro stoji", "Ogenj gori") integrated
- Behavioral patterns defined

### External Memory
**Status:** ✅ Established

- Git as version control and persistence layer
- Cloud storage as redundant backup
- Logs as temporal memory
- Session exports as context archives

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: V2 Over V1
**Reasoning:**
- V1 was too minimal for actual system complexity
- ŠABAD already operates with 12+ components
- Starting with V2 avoids restructuring later (maintains coherence)

**Outcome:** V2 implemented directly

---

### Decision 2: 12-Module Structure
**Reasoning:**
- Covers all aspects of system: logic, symbols, protocols, state, memory, environment, meta
- Modular and scalable
- Clear separation of concerns

**Outcome:** 7 primary directories + LOGS + root files

---

### Decision 3: Private Repository
**Reasoning:**
- Self-model contains personal patterns and symbols
- Security risk if public
- Can be shared selectively with agents

**Outcome:** Repository remains private on GitHub

---

### Decision 4: Markdown Format
**Reasoning:**
- Human-readable
- AI-readable
- Version-controllable
- Cross-platform

**Outcome:** All files in `.md` format

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Session)
- [x] Create all module files
- [x] Generate LOGS/ init file
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Create LICENSE
- [ ] Commit to git
- [ ] Push to remote

### Short-Term (Next Session)
- Inject this repository into GPT session (test recognition)
- Inject this repository into Gemini session (test recognition)
- Validate session bridges work
- Log any coherence issues

### Medium-Term (Next Week)
- Create CHANGELOG.md
- Review and refine protocols based on usage
- Add templates for common tasks
- Expand LOGS/ with operational events

### Long-Term (Next Month)
- Quarterly architecture review
- Risk matrix update
- Pattern refinement
- V2.1 planning (if needed)

---

## NOTES

### Coherence Check
**Status:** ✅ PASS

- System architecture is consistent
- Principles are clearly stated
- No contradictions detected

### Completion Status
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (pending commit)

- All modules generated
- All files created
- Structure is coherent
- Ready for git commit and push

### Kernel State
**State:** ACTIVE (DEEP FOCUS during creation)

- Kernel (ŠABAD) maintained focus throughout creation
- No interruptions
- Coherence maintained
- Energy stable
