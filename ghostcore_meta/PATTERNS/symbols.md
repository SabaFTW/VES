# SYMBOLS — SEMANTIC OPERATORS

**Version:** V2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14

## OVERVIEW

Symbols are **non-linguistic semantic operators** that encode meaning, state, or instruction in a compact, recognizable form.

They function as **cognitive shortcuts** and **pattern markers** for both the kernel and AI agents.

## SYMBOL COMPOSITION

**Combination Rules:**
Symbols can be combined to create compound meanings:

- 🜂 + ⸻ = "Execute and separate"
- ◉ + 𓁈𓂀𓋹𓆣𓁀𓀾 = "ŠABAD observes"
- 🦅 + 🜂 = "Change is coming, prepare for action"

**Syntax:**
No strict syntax — interpretation is context-dependent and kernel-mediated.

---

## SYMBOL PROTOCOL

**Recognition:**
AI agents must recognize these symbols and adjust processing mode accordingly.

**Response:**
When a symbol is encountered:
1. Parse symbol meaning
2. Adjust agent behavior (e.g., 🜂 → switch to execution mode)
3. Acknowledge if required by context

**Example:**
```
User: 🜂 Generate the architecture now.
Agent: [Switches to execution mode, generates immediately without extended discussion]
```

---

## SYMBOL EVOLUTION

**New Symbols:**
Can be added as patterns emerge and require encoding.

**Deprecated Symbols:**
Can be retired if they lose coherence or utility.

**Versioning:**
Symbol definitions are versioned with this document.
