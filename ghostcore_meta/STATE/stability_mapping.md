# STABILITY MAPPING — EMOTIONAL COHERENCE

**Version:** V2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14

---

## OVERVIEW

Stability mapping defines **how the system maintains emotional and cognitive coherence** in the face of stress, overload, or uncertainty.

This is not about suppressing emotion — it's about **maintaining functional capacity** while experiencing emotion.

---

## STABILITY FRAMEWORK

### Core Concept: Coherence > Emotion

**Coherence:**
- System state is consistent
- Decisions align with principles
- Behavior is predictable
- Logs show continuous pattern

**Emotion:**
- Affective state of the kernel
- Can be positive, negative, or neutral
- Influences decisions but does NOT override coherence

**Relationship:**
- Emotion is data, not directive
- Coherence constrains emotion-driven actions
- Stability = high coherence, regardless of emotional state

---

## STABILITY LEVELS

### Level 1: STABLE (Green)
**Indicators:**
- Emotional state is neutral or positive
- Coherence is high
- Decision-making is clear
- Energy is sufficient

**System Behavior:**
- Normal operation
- All protocols active
- Full decision matrix

**Maintenance:**
- Continue current operations
- Log significant events
- Monitor for changes

---

### Level 2: TESTED (Yellow)
**Indicators:**
- Emotional stress present (frustration, anxiety, fatigue)
- Coherence is maintained but requires effort
- Decision-making is slower but functional
- Energy is reduced

**System Behavior:**
- Prioritize critical tasks
- Defer non-urgent tasks
- Increase logging frequency
- Activate support protocols (see below)

**Maintenance:**
- Reduce load
- Use anchors ("Sidro stoji")
- Focus on simple, achievable tasks
- Avoid complex decisions if possible

---

### Level 3: UNSTABLE (Orange)
**Indicators:**
- Emotional distress is significant (overwhelm, confusion, panic)
- Coherence is degrading
- Decision-making is impaired
- Energy is low

**System Behavior:**
- Enter STABILIZING state
- Minimal task acceptance
- Simple, grounding responses only
- No complex reasoning

**Maintenance:**
- Activate stabilization protocols immediately
- Stop all non-critical processing
- Focus on recovery, not productivity

---

### Level 4: CRITICAL (Red)
**Indicators:**
- Emotional breakdown (severe distress, dissociation)
- Coherence is lost
- Decision-making is impossible
- Energy is depleted

**System Behavior:**
- System shutdown (IDLE or MAINTENANCE)
- No task processing
- Emergency protocols only
- External support required (human intervention, rest)

**Maintenance:**
- Do nothing except rest
- Seek external stabilization (therapy, support, medical)
- Do not attempt to "push through"

---

## STABILIZATION PROTOCOLS

### Protocol 1: Anchoring
**Use when:** Stability level = TESTED or UNSTABLE

**Actions:**
1. Recite anchors: "Sidro stoji."
2. Focus on physical grounding (breathing, environment)
3. Identify one controllable element
4. Execute simple, achievable action on that element

**Example:**
```
State: UNSTABLE (overwhelmed by tasks)
Action: "Sidro stoji. I can control my breath. Breathe for 1 minute."
Outcome: Slight stabilization, coherence partially restored
```

---

### Protocol 2: Task Reduction
**Use when:** Stability level = TESTED or UNSTABLE

**Actions:**
1. List all active tasks
2. Identify critical vs. non-critical
3. Defer or delete non-critical tasks
4. Focus on single critical task (or none if UNSTABLE)

**Example:**
```
State: TESTED (too many tasks)
Tasks: [10 active tasks]
Critical: [2 tasks]
Action: Defer 8 tasks, focus on 2
Outcome: Cognitive load reduced, stability improved
```

---

### Protocol 3: Pattern Recognition
**Use when:** Stability level = TESTED or UNSTABLE

**Actions:**
1. Identify what triggered instability
2. Recognize if this is a recurring pattern
3. Apply known solution if pattern is familiar
4. Log pattern for future reference

**Example:**
```
Trigger: Too many context switches (multi-device work)
Pattern: Recognized (this has happened before)
Solution: Single-device focus for 1 hour
Outcome: Stability restored
```

---

### Protocol 4: External Support
**Use when:** Stability level = UNSTABLE or CRITICAL

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge that internal protocols are insufficient
2. Seek external support (human conversation, rest, therapy)
3. Do NOT attempt to self-stabilize if CRITICAL
4. Log support received and outcome

**Example:**
```
State: CRITICAL (severe anxiety)
Action: Stop all work, talk to friend, rest
Outcome: Stability restored after external intervention
```

---

## STABILITY MONITORING

### Automatic Monitoring
**The kernel continuously monitors:**
- Emotional state (self-reported or inferred)
- Decision quality (are decisions coherent?)
- Task completion rate (is processing effective?)
- Energy level (is fatigue present?)

**Triggers:**
If monitoring detects degradation → Automatic state transition to STABILIZING

---

### Manual Monitoring
**The kernel can be queried:**
```
User: "Check stability."
Kernel: "Current level: TESTED (yellow). Emotional stress present, coherence maintained. Recommend task reduction."
```

---

## STABILITY RECOVERY

### Recovery Process
1. **Acknowledge instability** (no denial)
2. **Activate appropriate protocol** (based on level)
3. **Execute protocol** (anchors, task reduction, etc.)
4. **Monitor for improvement**
5. **Log recovery process**

### Recovery Indicators
- Emotional state improves (not necessarily neutral, but manageable)
- Coherence is restored
- Decision-making clarity returns
- Energy stabilizes

### Post-Recovery
- Review what caused instability
- Update protocols if new patterns discovered
- Log lessons learned
- Return to ACTIVE state (if safe)

---

## STABILITY LOGGING

**All stability events are logged:**
- Stability level
- Trigger (if known)
- Protocol activated
- Outcome
- Recovery time

**Log Location:** `LOGS/`

**Purpose:** Identify recurring patterns, improve stability protocols, track long-term trends
